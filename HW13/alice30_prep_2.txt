  and oh, my poor hands, how is it ican't see you
'  she was moving them about as she spoke, but noresult seemed to follow, except a little shaking among thedistant green leaves
  as there seemed to be no chance of getting her hands up to herhead, she tried to get her head down to them, and was delightedto find that her neck would bend about easily in any direction,like a serpent
  she had just succeeded in curving it down into agraceful zigzag, and was going to dive in among the leaves, whichshe found to be nothing but the tops of the trees under which shehad been wandering, when a sharp hiss made her draw back in ahurry:  a large pigeon had flown into her face, and was beatingher violently with its wings
  `serpent
' screamed the pigeon
  `i'm not a serpent
' said alice indignantly
  `let me alone
'  `serpent, i say again
' repeated the pigeon, but in a moresubdued tone, and added with a kind of sob, `i've tried everyway, and nothing seems to suit them
'  `i haven't the least idea what you're talking about,' saidalice
  `i've tried the roots of trees, and i've tried banks, and i'vetried hedges,' the pigeon went on, without attending to her; `butthose serpents
  there's no pleasing them
'  alice was more and more puzzled, but she thought there was nouse in saying anything more till the pigeon had finished
  `as if it wasn't trouble enough hatching the eggs,' said thepigeon; `but i must be on the look-out for serpents night andday
  why, i haven't had a wink of sleep these three weeks
'  `i'm very sorry you've been annoyed,' said alice, who wasbeginning to see its meaning
  `and just as i'd taken the highest tree in the wood,' continuedthe pigeon, raising its voice to a shriek, `and just as i wasthinking i should be free of them at last, they must needs comewriggling down from the sky
  ugh, serpent
'  `but i'm not a serpent, i tell you
' said alice
  `i'm a--i'ma--'  `well
  what are you
' said the pigeon
  `i can see you'retrying to invent something
'  `i--i'm a little girl,' said alice, rather doubtfully, as sheremembered the number of changes she had gone through that day
  `a likely story indeed
' said the pigeon in a tone of thedeepest contempt
  `i've seen a good many little girls in mytime, but never one with such a neck as that
  no, no
  you're aserpent; and there's no use denying it
  i suppose you'll betelling me next that you never tasted an egg
'  `i have tasted eggs, certainly,' said alice, who was a verytruthful child; `but little girls eat eggs quite as much asserpents do, you know
'  `i don't believe it,' said the pigeon; `but if they do, whythen they're a kind of serpent, that's all i can say
'  this was such a new idea to alice, that she was quite silentfor a minute or two, which gave the pigeon the opportunity ofadding, `you're looking for eggs, i know that well enough; andwhat does it matter to me whether you're a little girl or aserpent
'  `it matters a good deal to me,' said alice hastily; `but i'mnot looking for eggs, as it happens; and if i was, i shouldn'twant yours:  i don't like them raw
'  `well, be off, then
' said the pigeon in a sulky tone, as itsettled down again into its nest
  alice crouched down among thetrees as well as she could, for her neck kept getting entangledamong the branches, and every now and then she had to stop anduntwist it
  after a while she remembered that she still held thepieces of mushroom in her hands, and she set to work verycarefully, nibbling first at one and then at the other, andgrowing sometimes taller and sometimes shorter, until she hadsucceeded in bringing herself down to her usual height
  it was so long since she had been anything near the right size,that it felt quite strange at first; but she got used to it in afew minutes, and began talking to herself, as usual
  `come,there's half my plan done now
  how puzzling all these changesare
  i'm never sure what i'm going to be, from one minute toanother
  however, i've got back to my right size:  the nextthing is, to get into that beautiful garden--how is that to bedone, i wonder
'  as she said this, she came suddenly upon anopen place, with a little house in it about four feet high
`whoever lives there,' thought alice, `it'll never do to comeupon them this size:  why, i should frighten them out of theirwits
'  so she began nibbling at the righthand bit again, and didnot venture to go near the house till she had brought herselfdown to nine inches high
                           chapter vi                         pig and pepper  for a minute or two she stood looking at the house, andwondering what to do next, when suddenly a footman in livery camerunning out of the wood--(she considered him to be a footmanbecause he was in livery:  otherwise, judging by his face only,she would have called him a fish)--and rapped loudly at the doorwith his knuckles
  it was opened by another footman in livery,with a round face, and large eyes like a frog; and both footmen,alice noticed, had powdered hair that curled all over theirheads
  she felt very curious to know what it was all about, andcrept a little way out of the wood to listen
  the fish-footman began by producing from under his arm a greatletter, nearly as large as himself, and this he handed over tothe other, saying, in a solemn tone, `for the duchess
  aninvitation from the queen to play croquet
'  the frog-footmanrepeated, in the same solemn tone, only changing the order of thewords a little, `from the queen
  an invitation for the duchessto play croquet
'  then they both bowed low, and their curls got entangledtogether
  alice laughed so much at this, that she had to run back intothe wood for fear of their hearing her; and when she next peepedout the fish-footman was gone, and the other was sitting on theground near the door, staring stupidly up into the sky
  alice went timidly up to the door, and knocked
  `there's no sort of use in knocking,' said the footman, `andthat for two reasons
  first, because i'm on the same side of thedoor as you are; secondly, because they're making such a noiseinside, no one could possibly hear you
'  and certainly there wasa most extraordinary noise going on within--a constant howlingand sneezing, and every now and then a great crash, as if a dishor kettle had been broken to pieces
  `please, then,' said alice, `how am i to get in
'  `there might be some sense in your knocking,' the footman wenton without attending to her, `if we had the door between us
  forinstance, if you were inside, you might knock, and i could letyou out, you know
'  he was looking up into the sky all the timehe was speaking, and this alice thought decidedly uncivil
  `butperhaps he can't help it,' she said to herself; `his eyes are sovery nearly at the top of his head
  but at any rate he mightanswer questions
--how am i to get in
' she repeated, aloud
  `i shall sit here,' the footman remarked, `till tomorrow--'  at this moment the door of the house opened, and a large platecame skimming out, straight at the footman's head:  it justgrazed his nose, and broke to pieces against one of the treesbehind him
  `--or next day, maybe,' the footman continued in the same tone,exactly as if nothing had happened
  `how am i to get in
' asked alice again, in a louder tone
  `are you to get in at all
' said the footman
  `that's thefirst question, you know
'  it was, no doubt:  only alice did not like to be told so
`it's really dreadful,' she muttered to herself, `the way all thecreatures argue
  it's enough to drive one crazy
'  the footman seemed to think this a good opportunity forrepeating his remark, with variations
  `i shall sit here,' hesaid, `on and off, for days and days
'  `but what am i to do
' said alice
  `anything you like,' said the footman, and began whistling
  `oh, there's no use in talking to him,' said alice desperately:`he's perfectly idiotic
'  and she opened the door and went in
  the door led right into a large kitchen, which was full ofsmoke from one end to the other:  the duchess was sitting on athree-legged stool in the middle, nursing a baby; the cook wasleaning over the fire, stirring a large cauldron which seemed tobe full of soup
  `there's certainly too much pepper in that soup
' alice said toherself, as well as she could for sneezing
  there was certainly too much of it in the air
  even theduchess sneezed occasionally; and as for the baby, it wassneezing and howling alternately without a moment's pause
  theonly things in the kitchen that did not sneeze, were the cook,and a large cat which was sitting on the hearth and grinning fromear to ear
  `please would you tell me,' said alice, a little timidly, forshe was not quite sure whether it was good manners for her tospeak first, `why your cat grins like that
'  `it's a cheshire cat,' said the duchess, `and that's why
  pig
'  she said the last word with such sudden violence that alicequite jumped; but she saw in another moment that it was addressedto the baby, and not to her, so she took courage, and went onagain:--  `i didn't know that cheshire cats always grinned; in fact, ididn't know that cats could grin
'  `they all can,' said the duchess; `and most of 'em do
'  `i don't know of any that do,' alice said very politely,feeling quite pleased to have got into a conversation
  `you don't know much,' said the duchess; `and that's a fact
'  alice did not at all like the tone of this remark, and thoughtit would be as well to introduce some other subject ofconversation
  while she was trying to fix on one, the cook tookthe cauldron of soup off the fire, and at once set to workthrowing everything within her reach at the duchess and the baby--the fire-irons came first; then followed a shower of saucepans,plates, and dishes
  the duchess took no notice of them even whenthey hit her; and the baby was howling so much already, that itwas quite impossible to say whether the blows hurt it or not
  `oh, please mind what you're doing
' cried alice, jumping upand down in an agony of terror
  `oh, there goes his preciousnose'; as an unusually large saucepan flew close by it, and verynearly carried it off
  `if everybody minded their own business,' the duchess said in ahoarse growl, `the world would go round a deal faster than itdoes
'  `which would not be an advantage,' said alice, who felt veryglad to get an opportunity of showing off a little of herknowledge
  `just think of what work it would make with the dayand night
  you see the earth takes twenty-four hours to turnround on its axis--'  `talking of axes,' said the duchess, `chop off her head
'  alice glanced rather anxiously at the cook, to see if she meantto take the hint; but the cook was busily stirring the soup, andseemed not to be listening, so she went on again:  `twenty-fourhours, i think; or is it twelve
  i--'  `oh, don't bother me,' said the duchess; `i never could abidefigures
'  and with that she began nursing her child again,singing a sort of lullaby to it as she did so, and giving it aviolent shake at the end of every line:        `speak roughly to your little boy,          and beat him when he sneezes:        he only does it to annoy,          because he knows it teases
'                    chorus
    (in which the cook and the baby joined):--                `wow
 wow
 wow
'  while the duchess sang the second verse of the song, she kepttossing the baby violently up and down, and the poor little thinghowled so, that alice could hardly hear the words:--        `i speak severely to my boy,          i beat him when he sneezes;        for he can thoroughly enjoy          the pepper when he pleases
'                    chorus
                `wow
 wow
 wow
'  `here
 you may nurse it a bit, if you like
' the duchess saidto alice, flinging the baby at her as she spoke
  `i must go andget ready to play croquet with the queen,' and she hurried out ofthe room
  the cook threw a frying-pan after her as she went out,but it just missed her
  alice caught the baby with some difficulty, as it was a queer-shaped little creature, and held out its arms and legs in alldirections, `just like a star-fish,' thought alice
  the poorlittle thing was snorting like a steam-engine when she caught it,and kept doubling itself up and straightening itself out again,so that altogether, for the first minute or two, it was as muchas she could do to hold it
  as soon as she had made out the proper way of nursing it,(which was to twist it up into a sort of knot, and then keeptight hold of its right ear and left foot, so as to prevent itsundoing itself,) she carried it out into the open air
  `if idon't take this child away with me,' thought alice, `they're sureto kill it in a day or two:  wouldn't it be murder to leave itbehind
'  she said the last words out loud, and the little thinggrunted in reply (it had left off sneezing by this time)
  `don'tgrunt,' said alice; `that's not at all a proper way of expressingyourself
'  the baby grunted again, and alice looked very anxiously intoits face to see what was the matter with it
  there could be nodoubt that it had a very turn-up nose, much more like a snoutthan a real nose; also its eyes were getting extremely small fora baby:  altogether alice did not like the look of the thing atall
  `but perhaps it was only sobbing,' she thought, and lookedinto its eyes again, to see if there were any tears
  no, there were no tears
  `if you're going to turn into a pig,my dear,' said alice, seriously, `i'll have nothing more to dowith you
  mind now
'  the poor little thing sobbed again (orgrunted, it was impossible to say which), and they went on forsome while in silence
  alice was just beginning to think to herself, `now, what am ito do with this creature when i get it home
' when it gruntedagain, so violently, that she looked down into its face in somealarm
  this time there could be no mistake about it:  it wasneither more nor less than a pig, and she felt that it would bequite absurd for her to carry it further
  so she set the little creature down, and felt quite relieved tosee it trot away quietly into the wood
  `if it had grown up,'she said to herself, `it would have made a dreadfully ugly child:but it makes rather a handsome pig, i think
'  and she beganthinking over other children she knew, who might do very well aspigs, and was just saying to herself, `if one only knew the rightway to change them--' when she was a little startled by seeingthe cheshire cat sitting on a bough of a tree a few yards off
  the cat only grinned when it saw alice
  it looked good-natured, she thought:  still it had very long claws and a greatmany teeth, so she felt that it ought to be treated with respect
  `cheshire puss,' she began, rather timidly, as she did not atall know whether it would like the name:  however, it onlygrinned a little wider
  `come, it's pleased so far,' thoughtalice, and she went on
  `would you tell me, please, which way iought to go from here
'  `that depends a good deal on where you want to get to,' saidthe cat
  `i don't much care where--' said alice
  `then it doesn't matter which way you go,' said the cat
  `--so long as i get somewhere,' alice added as an explanation
  `oh, you're sure to do that,' said the cat, `if you only walklong enough
'  alice felt that this could not be denied, so she tried anotherquestion
  `what sort of people live about here
'  `in that direction,' the cat said, waving its right paw round,`lives a hatter:  and in that direction,' waving the other paw,`lives a march hare
  visit either you like:  they're both mad
'  `but i don't want to go among mad people,' alice remarked
  `oh, you can't help that,' said the cat:  `we're all mad here
i'm mad
  you're mad
'  `how do you know i'm mad
' said alice
  `you must be,' said the cat, `or you wouldn't have come here
'  alice didn't think that proved it at all; however, she went on`and how do you know that you're mad
'  `to begin with,' said the cat, `a dog's not mad
  you grantthat
'  `i suppose so,' said alice
  `well, then,' the cat went on, `you see, a dog growls when it'sangry, and wags its tail when it's pleased
  now i growl when i'mpleased, and wag my tail when i'm angry
  therefore i'm mad
'  `i call it purring, not growling,' said alice
  `call it what you like,' said the cat
  `do you play croquetwith the queen to-day
'  `i should like it very much,' said alice, `but i haven't beeninvited yet
'  `you'll see me there,' said the cat, and vanished
  alice was not much surprised at this, she was getting so usedto queer things happening
  while she was looking at the placewhere it had been, it suddenly appeared again
  `by-the-bye, what became of the baby
' said the cat
  `i'dnearly forgotten to ask
'  `it turned into a pig,' alice quietly said, just as if it hadcome back in a natural way
  `i thought it would,' said the cat, and vanished again
  alice waited a little, half expecting to see it again, but itdid not appear, and after a minute or two she walked on in thedirection in which the march hare was said to live
  `i've seenhatters before,' she said to herself; `the march hare will bemuch the most interesting, and perhaps as this is may it won't beraving mad--at least not so mad as it was in march
'  as she saidthis, she looked up, and there was the cat again, sitting on abranch of a tree
  `did you say pig, or fig
' said the cat
  `i said pig,' replied alice; `and i wish you wouldn't keepappearing and vanishing so suddenly:  you make one quite giddy
'  `all right,' said the cat; and this time it vanished quite slowly,beginning with the end of the tail, and ending with the grin,which remained some time after the rest of it had gone
  `well
  i've often seen a cat without a grin,' thought alice;`but a grin without a cat
  it's the most curious thing i eversaw in my life
'  she had not gone much farther before she came in sight of thehouse of the march hare:  she thought it must be the right house,because the chimneys were shaped like ears and the roof wasthatched with fur
  it was so large a house, that she did notlike to go nearer till she had nibbled some more of the lefthandbit of mushroom, and raised herself to about two feet high:  eventhen she walked up towards it rather timidly, saying to herself`suppose it should be raving mad after all
  i almost wish i'dgone to see the hatter instead
'                           chapter vii                         a mad tea-party  there was a table set out under a tree in front of the house,and the march hare and the hatter were having tea at it:  adormouse was sitting between them, fast asleep, and the other twowere using it as a cushion, resting their elbows on it, and talkingover its head
  `very uncomfortable for the dormouse,' thought alice;`only, as it's asleep, i suppose it doesn't mind
'  the table was a large one, but the three were all crowdedtogether at one corner of it:  `no room
  no room
' they criedout when they saw alice coming
  `there's plenty of room
' saidalice indignantly, and she sat down in a large arm-chair at oneend of the table
  `have some wine,' the march hare said in an encouraging tone
  alice looked all round the table, but there was nothing on itbut tea
  `i don't see any wine,' she remarked
  `there isn't any,' said the march hare
  `then it wasn't very civil of you to offer it,' said aliceangrily
  `it wasn't very civil of you to sit down without beinginvited,' said the march hare
  `i didn't know it was your table,' said alice; `it's laid for agreat many more than three
'  `your hair wants cutting,' said the hatter
  he had beenlooking at alice for some time with great curiosity, and this washis first speech
  `you should learn not to make personal remarks,' alice saidwith some severity; `it's very rude
'  the hatter opened his eyes very wide on hearing this; but allhe said was, `why is a raven like a writing-desk
'  `come, we shall have some fun now
' thought alice
  `i'm gladthey've begun asking riddles
--i believe i can guess that,' sheadded aloud
  `do you mean that you think you can find out the answer to it
'said the march hare
  `exactly so,' said alice
  `then you should say what you mean,' the march hare went on
  `i do,' alice hastily replied; `at least--at least i mean whati say--that's the same thing, you know
'  `not the same thing a bit
' said the hatter
  `you might justas well say that "i see what i eat" is the same thing as "i eatwhat i see"
'  `you might just as well say,' added the march hare, `that "ilike what i get" is the same thing as "i get what i like"
'  `you might just as well say,' added the dormouse, who seemed tobe talking in his sleep, `that "i breathe when i sleep" is thesame thing as "i sleep when i breathe"
'  `it is the same thing with you,' said the hatter, and here theconversation dropped, and the party sat silent for a minute,while alice thought over all she could remember about ravens andwriting-desks, which wasn't much
  the hatter was the first to break the silence
  `what day ofthe month is it
' he said, turning to alice:  he had taken hiswatch out of his pocket, and was looking at it uneasily, shakingit every now and then, and holding it to his ear
  alice considered a little, and then said `the fourth
'  `two days wrong
' sighed the hatter
  `i told you butterwouldn't suit the works
' he added looking angrily at the marchhare
  `it was the best butter,' the march hare meekly replied
  `yes, but some crumbs must have got in as well,' the hattergrumbled:  `you shouldn't have put it in with the bread-knife
'  the march hare took the watch and looked at it gloomily:  thenhe dipped it into his cup of tea, and looked at it again:  but hecould think of nothing better to say than his first remark, `itwas the best butter, you know
'  alice had been looking over his shoulder with some curiosity
`what a funny watch
' she remarked
  `it tells the day of themonth, and doesn't tell what o'clock it is
'  `why should it
' muttered the hatter
  `does your watch tellyou what year it is
'  `of course not,' alice replied very readily:  `but that'sbecause it stays the same year for such a long time together
'  `which is just the case with mine,' said the hatter
  alice felt dreadfully puzzled
  the hatter's remark seemed tohave no sort of meaning in it, and yet it was certainly english
`i don't quite understand you,' she said, as politely as shecould
  `the dormouse is asleep again,' said the hatter, and he poureda little hot tea upon its nose
  the dormouse shook its head impatiently, and said, withoutopening its eyes, `of course, of course; just what i was going toremark myself
'  `have you guessed the riddle yet
' the hatter said, turning toalice again
  `no, i give it up,' alice replied:  `what's the answer
'  `i haven't the slightest idea,' said the hatter
  `nor i,' said the march hare
  alice sighed wearily
  `i think you might do something betterwith the time,' she said, `than waste it in asking riddles thathave no answers
'  `if you knew time as well as i do,' said the hatter, `youwouldn't talk about wasting it
  it's him
'  `i don't know what you mean,' said alice
  `of course you don't
' the hatter said, tossing his headcontemptuously
  `i dare say you never even spoke to time
'  `perhaps not,' alice cautiously replied:  `but i know i have tobeat time when i learn music
'  `ah
 that accounts for it,' said the hatter
  `he won't standbeating
  now, if you only kept on good terms with him, he'd doalmost anything you liked with the clock
  for instance, supposeit were nine o'clock in the morning, just time to begin lessons:you'd only have to whisper a hint to time, and round goes theclock in a twinkling
  half-past one, time for dinner
'  (`i only wish it was,' the march hare said to itself in awhisper
)  `that would be grand, certainly,' said alice thoughtfully:`but then--i shouldn't be hungry for it, you know
'  `not at first, perhaps,' said the hatter:  `but you could keepit to half-past one as long as you liked
'  `is that the way you manage
' alice asked
  the hatter shook his head mournfully
  `not i
' he replied
`we quarrelled last march--just before he went mad, you know--'(pointing with his tea spoon at the march hare,) `--it was at thegreat concert given by the queen of hearts, and i had to sing            "twinkle, twinkle, little bat
            how i wonder what you're at
"you know the song, perhaps
'  `i've heard something like it,' said alice
  `it goes on, you know,' the hatter continued, `in this way:--            "up above the world you fly,            like a tea-tray in the sky
                    twinkle, twinkle--"'here the dormouse shook itself, and began singing in its sleep`twinkle, twinkle, twinkle, twinkle--' and went on so long thatthey had to pinch it to make it stop
  `well, i'd hardly finished the first verse,' said the hatter,`when the queen jumped up and bawled out, "he's murdering thetime
  off with his head
"'  `how dreadfully savage
' exclaimed alice
  `and ever since that,' the hatter went on in a mournful tone,`he won't do a thing i ask
  it's always six o'clock now
'  a bright idea came into alice's head
  `is that the reason somany tea-things are put out here
' she asked
  `yes, that's it,' said the hatter with a sigh:  `it's alwaystea-time, and we've no time to wash the things between whiles
'  `then you keep moving round, i suppose
' said alice
  `exactly so,' said the hatter:  `as the things get used up
'  `but what happens when you come to the beginning again
' aliceventured to ask
  `suppose we change the subject,' the march hare interrupted,yawning
  `i'm getting tired of this
  i vote the young ladytells us a story
'  `i'm afraid i don't know one,' said alice, rather alarmed atthe proposal
  `then the dormouse shall
' they both cried
  `wake up,dormouse
'  and they pinched it on both sides at once
  the dormouse slowly opened his eyes
  `i wasn't asleep,' hesaid in a hoarse, feeble voice:  `i heard every word you fellowswere saying
'  `tell us a story
' said the march hare
  `yes, please do
' pleaded alice
  `and be quick about it,' added the hatter, `or you'll be asleepagain before it's done
'  `once upon a time there were three little sisters,' thedormouse began in a great hurry; `and their names were elsie,lacie, and tillie; and they lived at the bottom of a well--'  `what did they live on
' said alice, who always took a greatinterest in questions of eating and drinking
  `they lived on treacle,' said the dormouse, after thinking aminute or two
  `they couldn't have done that, you know,' alice gentlyremarked; `they'd have been ill
'  `so they were,' said the dormouse; `very ill
'  alice tried to fancy to herself what such an extraordinary waysof living would be like, but it puzzled her too much, so she wenton:  `but why did they live at the bottom of a well
'  `take some more tea,' the march hare said to alice, veryearnestly
  `i've had nothing yet,' alice replied in an offended tone, `soi can't take more
'  `you mean you can't take less,' said the hatter:  `it's veryeasy to take more than nothing
'  `nobody asked your opinion,' said alice
  `who's making personal remarks now
' the hatter askedtriumphantly
  alice did not quite know what to say to this:  so she helpedherself to some tea and bread-and-butter, and then turned to thedormouse, and repeated her question
  `why did they live at thebottom of a well
'  the dormouse again took a minute or two to think about it, andthen said, `it was a treacle-well
'  `there's no such thing
'  alice was beginning very angrily, butthe hatter and the march hare went `sh
 sh
' and the dormousesulkily remarked, `if you can't be civil, you'd better finish thestory for yourself
'  `no, please go on
' alice said very humbly; `i won't interruptagain
  i dare say there may be one
'  `one, indeed
' said the dormouse indignantly
  however, heconsented to go on
  `and so these three little sisters--theywere learning to draw, you know--'  `what did they draw
' said alice, quite forgetting her promise
  `treacle,' said the dormouse, without considering at all thistime
  `i want a clean cup,' interrupted the hatter:  `let's all moveone place on
'  he moved on as he spoke, and the dormouse followed him:  themarch hare moved into the dormouse's place, and alice ratherunwillingly took the place of the march hare
  the hatter was theonly one who got any advantage from the change:  and alice was agood deal worse off than before, as the march hare had just upsetthe milk-jug into his plate
  alice did not wish to offend the dormouse again, so she beganvery cautiously:  `but i don't understand
  where did they drawthe treacle from
'  `you can draw water out of a water-well,' said the hatter; `soi should think you could draw treacle out of a treacle-well--eh,stupid
'  `but they were in the well,' alice said to the dormouse, notchoosing to notice this last remark
  `of course they were', said the dormouse; `--well in
'  this answer so confused poor alice, that she let the dormousego on for some time without interrupting it
  `they were learning to draw,' the dormouse went on, yawning andrubbing its eyes, for it was getting very sleepy; `and they drewall manner of things--everything that begins with an m--'  `why with an m
' said alice
  `why not
' said the march hare
  alice was silent
  the dormouse had closed its eyes by this time, and was goingoff into a doze; but, on being pinched by the hatter, it woke upagain with a little shriek, and went on:  `--that begins with anm, such as mouse-traps, and the moon, and memory, and muchness--you know you say things are "much of a muchness"--did you eversee such a thing as a drawing of a muchness
'  `really, now you ask me,' said alice, very much confused, `idon't think--'  `then you shouldn't talk,' said the hatter
  this piece of rudeness was more than alice could bear:  she gotup in great disgust, and walked off; the dormouse fell asleepinstantly, and neither of the others took the least notice of hergoing, though she looked back once or twice, half hoping thatthey would call after her:  the last time she saw them, they weretrying to put the dormouse into the teapot
  `at any rate i'll never go there again
' said alice as shepicked her way through the wood
  `it's the stupidest tea-party iever was at in all my life
'  just as she said this, she noticed that one of the trees had adoor leading right into it
  `that's very curious
' she thought
`but everything's curious today
  i think i may as well go in at once
'and in she went
  once more she found herself in the long hall, and close to thelittle glass table
  `now, i'll manage better this time,'she said to herself, and began by taking the little golden key,and unlocking the door that led into the garden
  then she wentto work nibbling at the mushroom (she had kept a piece of itin her pocket) till she was about a foot high:  then she walked downthe little passage:  and then--she found herself at last in thebeautiful garden, among the bright flower-beds and the cool fountains
                          chapter viii                   the queen's croquet-ground  a large rose-tree stood near the entrance of the garden:  theroses growing on it were white, but there were three gardeners atit, busily painting them red
  alice thought this a very curiousthing, and she went nearer to watch them, and just as she came upto them she heard one of them say, `look out now, five
  don't gosplashing paint over me like that
'  `i couldn't help it,' said five, in a sulky tone; `seven joggedmy elbow
'  on which seven looked up and said, `that's right, five
  alwayslay the blame on others
'  `you'd better not talk
' said five
  `i heard the queen say onlyyesterday you deserved to be beheaded
'  `what for
' said the one who had spoken first
  `that's none of your business, two
' said seven
  `yes, it is his business
' said five, `and i'll tell him--itwas for bringing the cook tulip-roots instead of onions
'  seven flung down his brush, and had just begun `well, of allthe unjust things--' when his eye chanced to fall upon alice, asshe stood watching them, and he checked himself suddenly:  theothers looked round also, and all of them bowed low
  `would you tell me,' said alice, a little timidly, `why you arepainting those roses
'  five and seven said nothing, but looked at two
  two began in alow voice, `why the fact is, you see, miss, this here ought tohave been a red rose-tree, and we put a white one in by mistake;and if the queen was to find it out, we should all have our headscut off, you know
  so you see, miss, we're doing our best, aforeshe comes, to--'  at this moment five, who had been anxiouslylooking across the garden, called out `the queen
  the queen
'and the three gardeners instantly threw themselves flat upontheir faces
  there was a sound of many footsteps, and alicelooked round, eager to see the queen
  first came ten soldiers carrying clubs; these were all shapedlike the three gardeners, oblong and flat, with their hands andfeet at the corners:  next the ten courtiers; these wereornamented all over with diamonds, and walked two and two, as thesoldiers did
  after these came the royal children; there wereten of them, and the little dears came jumping merrily along handin hand, in couples:  they were all ornamented with hearts
  nextcame the guests, mostly kings and queens, and among them alicerecognised the white rabbit:  it was talking in a hurried nervousmanner, smiling at everything that was said, and went by withoutnoticing her
  then followed the knave of hearts, carrying theking's crown on a crimson velvet cushion; and, last of all thisgrand procession, came the king and queen of hearts
  alice was rather doubtful whether she ought not to lie down onher face like the three gardeners, but she could not rememberever having heard of such a rule at processions; `and besides,what would be the use of a procession,' thought she, `if peoplehad all to lie down upon their faces, so that they couldn't see it
'so she stood still where she was, and waited
  when the procession came opposite to alice, they all stoppedand looked at her, and the queen said severely `who is this
'she said it to the knave of hearts, who only bowed and smiled in reply
  `idiot
' said the queen, tossing her head impatiently; and,turning to alice, she went on, `what's your name, child
'  `my name is alice, so please your majesty,' said alice verypolitely; but she added, to herself, `why, they're only a pack ofcards, after all
  i needn't be afraid of them
'  `and who are these
' said the queen, pointing to the threegardeners who were lying round the rosetree; for, you see, asthey were lying on their faces, and the pattern on their backswas the same as the rest of the pack, she could not tell whetherthey were gardeners, or soldiers, or courtiers, or three of herown children
  `how should i know
' said alice, surprised at her own courage
`it's no business of mine
'  the queen turned crimson with fury, and, after glaring at herfor a moment like a wild beast, screamed `off with her head
off--'  `nonsense
' said alice, very loudly and decidedly, and thequeen was silent
  the king laid his hand upon her arm, and timidly said`consider, my dear:  she is only a child
'  the queen turned angrily away from him, and said to the knave`turn them over
'  the knave did so, very carefully, with one foot
  `get up
' said the queen, in a shrill, loud voice, and thethree gardeners instantly jumped up, and began bowing to theking, the queen, the royal children, and everybody else
  `leave off that
' screamed the queen
  `you make me giddy
'and then, turning to the rose-tree, she went on, `what have youbeen doing here
'  `may it please your majesty,' said two, in a very humble tone,going down on one knee as he spoke, `we were trying--'  `i see
' said the queen, who had meanwhile been examining theroses
  `off with their heads
' and the procession moved on,three of the soldiers remaining behind to execute the unfortunategardeners, who ran to alice for protection
  `you shan't be beheaded
' said alice, and she put them into alarge flower-pot that stood near
  the three soldiers wanderedabout for a minute or two, looking for them, and then quietlymarched off after the others
  `are their heads off
' shouted the queen
  `their heads are gone, if it please your majesty
' the soldiersshouted in reply
  `that's right
' shouted the queen
  `can you play croquet
'  the soldiers were silent, and looked at alice, as the questionwas evidently meant for her
  `yes
' shouted alice
  `come on, then
' roared the queen, and alice joined theprocession, wondering very much what would happen next
  `it's--it's a very fine day
' said a timid voice at her side
she was walking by the white rabbit, who was peeping anxiouslyinto her face
  `very,' said alice:  `--where's the duchess
'  `hush
  hush
' said the rabbit in a low, hurried tone
  helooked anxiously over his shoulder as he spoke, and then raisedhimself upon tiptoe, put his mouth close to her ear, andwhispered `she's under sentence of execution
'  `what for
' said alice
  `did you say "what a pity
"
' the rabbit asked
  `no, i didn't,' said alice:  `i don't think it's at all a pity
i said "what for
"'  `she boxed the queen's ears--' the rabbit began
  alice gave alittle scream of laughter
  `oh, hush
' the rabbit whispered in afrightened tone
  `the queen will hear you
  you see, she camerather late, and the queen said--'  `get to your places
' shouted the queen in a voice of thunder,and people began running about in all directions, tumbling upagainst each other; however, they got settled down in a minute ortwo, and the game began
  alice thought she had never seen such acurious croquet-ground in her life; it was all ridges andfurrows; the balls were live hedgehogs, the mallets liveflamingoes, and the soldiers had to double themselves up and tostand on their hands and feet, to make the arches
  the chief difficulty alice found at first was in managing herflamingo:  she succeeded in getting its body tucked away,comfortably enough, under her arm, with its legs hanging down,but generally, just as she had got its neck nicely straightenedout, and was going to give the hedgehog a blow with its head, itwould twist itself round and look up in her face, with such apuzzled expression that she could not help bursting out laughing:and when she had got its head down, and was going to begin again,it was very provoking to find that the hedgehog had unrolleditself, and was in the act of crawling away:  besides all this,there was generally a ridge or furrow in the way wherever shewanted to send the hedgehog to, and, as the doubled-up soldierswere always getting up and walking off to other parts of theground, alice soon came to the conclusion that it was a verydifficult game indeed
  the players all played at once without waiting for turns,quarrelling all the while, and fighting for the hedgehogs; and ina very short time the queen was in a furious passion, and wentstamping about, and shouting `off with his head
' or `off withher head
' about once in a minute
  alice began to feel very uneasy:  to be sure, she had not asyet had any dispute with the queen, but she knew that it mighthappen any minute, `and then,' thought she, `what would become ofme
  they're dreadfully fond of beheading people here; the greatwonder is, that there's any one left alive
'  she was looking about for some way of escape, and wonderingwhether she could get away without being seen, when she noticed acurious appearance in the air:  it puzzled her very much atfirst, but, after watching it a minute or two, she made it out tobe a grin, and she said to herself `it's the cheshire cat:  now ishall have somebody to talk to
'  `how are you getting on
' said the cat, as soon as there wasmouth enough for it to speak with
  alice waited till the eyes appeared, and then nodded
  `it's nouse speaking to it,' she thought, `till its ears have come, or atleast one of them
'  in another minute the whole head appeared,and then alice put down her flamingo, and began an account of thegame, feeling very glad she had someone to listen to her
  thecat seemed to think that there was enough of it now in sight, andno more of it appeared
  `i don't think they play at all fairly,' alice began, in rathera complaining tone, `and they all quarrel so dreadfully one can'thear oneself speak--and they don't seem to have any rules inparticular; at least, if there are, nobody attends to them--andyou've no idea how confusing it is all the things being alive;for instance, there's the arch i've got to go through nextwalking about at the other end of the ground--and i should havecroqueted the queen's hedgehog just now, only it ran away when itsaw mine coming
'  `how do you like the queen
' said the cat in a low voice
  `not at all,' said alice:  `she's so extremely--'  just thenshe noticed that the queen was close behind her, listening:  soshe went on, `--likely to win, that it's hardly worth whilefinishing the game
'  the queen smiled and passed on
  `who are you talking to
' said the king, going up to alice, andlooking at the cat's head with great curiosity
  `it's a friend of mine--a cheshire cat,' said alice:  `allow meto introduce it
'  `i don't like the look of it at all,' said the king:`however, it may kiss my hand if it likes
'  `i'd rather not,' the cat remarked
  `don't be impertinent,' said the king, `and don't look at melike that
'  he got behind alice as he spoke
  `a cat may look at a king,' said alice
  `i've read that insome book, but i don't remember where
'  `well, it must be removed,' said the king very decidedly, andhe called the queen, who was passing at the moment, `my dear
  iwish you would have this cat removed
'  the queen had only one way of settling all difficulties, greator small
  `off with his head
' she said, without even lookinground
  `i'll fetch the executioner myself,' said the king eagerly, andhe hurried off
  alice thought she might as well go back, and see how the gamewas going on, as she heard the queen's voice in the distance,screaming with passion
  she had already heard her sentence threeof the players to be executed for having missed their turns, andshe did not like the look of things at all, as the game was insuch confusion that she never knew whether it was her turn ornot
  so she went in search of her hedgehog
  the hedgehog was engaged in a fight with another hedgehog,which seemed to alice an excellent opportunity for croqueting oneof them with the other:  the only difficulty was, that herflamingo was gone across to the other side of the garden, wherealice could see it trying in a helpless sort of way to fly upinto a tree
  by the time she had caught the flamingo and brought it back,the fight was over, and both the hedgehogs were out of sight:`but it doesn't matter much,' thought alice, `as all the archesare gone from this side of the ground
'  so she tucked it awayunder her arm, that it might not escape again, and went back fora little more conversation with her friend
  when she got back to the cheshire cat, she was surprised tofind quite a large crowd collected round it:  there was a disputegoing on between the executioner, the king, and the queen, whowere all talking at once, while all the rest were quite silent,and looked very uncomfortable
  the moment alice appeared, she was appealed to by all three tosettle the question, and they repeated their arguments to her,though, as they all spoke at once, she found it very hard indeedto make out exactly what they said
  the executioner's argument was, that you couldn't cut off ahead unless there was a body to cut it off from:  that he hadnever had to do such a thing before, and he wasn't going to beginat his time of life
  the king's argument was, that anything that had a head could bebeheaded, and that you weren't to talk nonsense
  the queen's argument was, that if something wasn't done aboutit in less than no time she'd have everybody executed, all round
(it was this last remark that had made the whole party look sograve and anxious
)  alice could think of nothing else to say but `it belongs to theduchess:  you'd better ask her about it
'  `she's in prison,' the queen said to the executioner:  `fetchher here
'  and the executioner went off like an arrow
   the cat's head began fading away the moment he was gone, and,by the time he had come back with the dutchess, it had entirelydisappeared; so the king and the executioner ran wildly up and downlooking for it, while the rest of the party went back to the game
                           chapter ix                     the mock turtle's story  `you can't think how glad i am to see you again, you dear oldthing
' said the duchess, as she tucked her arm affectionatelyinto alice's, and they walked off together
  alice was very glad to find her in such a pleasant temper, andthought to herself that perhaps it was only the pepper that hadmade her so savage when they met in the kitchen
  `when i'm a duchess,' she said to herself, (not in a veryhopeful tone though), `i won't have any pepper in my kitchen atall
  soup does very well without--maybe it's always pepper thatmakes people hot-tempered,' she went on, very much pleased athaving found out a new kind of rule, `and vinegar that makes themsour--and camomile that makes them bitter--and--and barley-sugarand such things that make children sweet-tempered
  i only wishpeople knew that:  then they wouldn't be so stingy about it, youknow--'  she had quite forgotten the duchess by this time, and was alittle startled when she heard her voice close to her ear
`you're thinking about something, my dear, and that makes youforget to talk
  i can't tell you just now what the moral of thatis, but i shall remember it in a bit
'  `perhaps it hasn't one,' alice ventured to remark
  `tut, tut, child
' said the duchess
  `everything's got amoral, if only you can find it
'  and she squeezed herself upcloser to alice's side as she spoke
  alice did not much like keeping so close to her:  first,because the duchess was very ugly; and secondly, because she wasexactly the right height to rest her chin upon alice's shoulder,and it was an uncomfortably sharp chin
  however, she did notlike to be rude, so she bore it as well as she could
  `the game's going on rather better now,' she said, by way ofkeeping up the conversation a little
  `'tis so,' said the duchess:  `and the moral of that is--"oh,'tis love, 'tis love, that makes the world go round
"'  `somebody said,' alice whispered, `that it's done by everybodyminding their own business
'  `ah, well
  it means much the same thing,' said the duchess,digging her sharp little chin into alice's shoulder as she added,`and the moral of that is--"take care of the sense, and thesounds will take care of themselves
"'  `how fond she is of finding morals in things
' alice thought toherself
  `i dare say you're wondering why i don't put my arm round yourwaist,' the duchess said after a pause:  `the reason is, that i'mdoubtful about the temper of your flamingo
  shall i try theexperiment
'  `he might bite,' alice cautiously replied, not feeling at allanxious to have the experiment tried
  `very true,' said the duchess:  `flamingoes and mustard bothbite
  and the moral of that is--"birds of a feather flocktogether
"'  `only mustard isn't a bird,' alice remarked
  `right, as usual,' said the duchess:  `what a clear way youhave of putting things
