                alice's adventures in wonderland                          lewis carroll               the millennium fulcrum edition 3
0                            chapter i                      down the rabbit-hole  alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sisteron the bank, and of having nothing to do:  once or twice she hadpeeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had nopictures or conversations in it, `and what is the use of a book,'thought alice `without pictures or conversation
'  so she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could,for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whetherthe pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the troubleof getting up and picking the daisies, when suddenly a whiterabbit with pink eyes ran close by her
  there was nothing so very remarkable in that; nor did alicethink it so very much out of the way to hear the rabbit say toitself, `oh dear
  oh dear
  i shall be late
'  (when she thoughtit over afterwards, it occurred to her that she ought to havewondered at this, but at the time it all seemed quite natural);but when the rabbit actually took a watch out of its waistcoat-pocket, and looked at it, and then hurried on, alice started toher feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had neverbefore seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch totake out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across thefield after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it popdown a large rabbit-hole under the hedge
  in another moment down went alice after it, never onceconsidering how in the world she was to get out again
  the rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way,and then dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that alice had not amoment to think about stopping herself before she found herselffalling down a very deep well
  either the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for shehad plenty of time as she went down to look about her and towonder what was going to happen next
  first, she tried to lookdown and make out what she was coming to, but it was too dark tosee anything; then she looked at the sides of the well, andnoticed that they were filled with cupboards and book-shelves;here and there she saw maps and pictures hung upon pegs
  shetook down a jar from one of the shelves as she passed; it waslabelled `orange marmalade', but to her great disappointment itwas empty:  she did not like to drop the jar for fear of killingsomebody, so managed to put it into one of the cupboards as shefell past it
  `well
' thought alice to herself, `after such a fall as this, ishall think nothing of tumbling down stairs
  how brave they'llall think me at home
  why, i wouldn't say anything about it,even if i fell off the top of the house
' (which was very likelytrue
)  down, down, down
  would the fall never come to an end
  `iwonder how many miles i've fallen by this time
' she said aloud
`i must be getting somewhere near the centre of the earth
  letme see:  that would be four thousand miles down, i think--' (for,you see, alice had learnt several things of this sort in herlessons in the schoolroom, and though this was not a very goodopportunity for showing off her knowledge, as there was no one tolisten to her, still it was good practice to say it over) `--yes,that's about the right distance--but then i wonder what latitudeor longitude i've got to
'  (alice had no idea what latitude was,or longitude either, but thought they were nice grand words tosay
)  presently she began again
  `i wonder if i shall fall rightthrough the earth
  how funny it'll seem to come out among thepeople that walk with their heads downward
  the antipathies, ithink--' (she was rather glad there was no one listening, thistime, as it didn't sound at all the right word) `--but i shallhave to ask them what the name of the country is, you know
please, ma'am, is this new zealand or australia
' (and she triedto curtsey as she spoke--fancy curtseying as you're fallingthrough the air
  do you think you could manage it
)  `and whatan ignorant little girl she'll think me for asking
  no, it'llnever do to ask:  perhaps i shall see it written up somewhere
'  down, down, down
  there was nothing else to do, so alice soonbegan talking again
  `dinah'll miss me very much to-night, ishould think
'  (dinah was the cat
)  `i hope they'll rememberher saucer of milk at tea-time
  dinah my dear
  i wish you weredown here with me
  there are no mice in the air, i'm afraid, butyou might catch a bat, and that's very like a mouse, you know
but do cats eat bats, i wonder
'  and here alice began to getrather sleepy, and went on saying to herself, in a dreamy sort ofway, `do cats eat bats
  do cats eat bats
' and sometimes, `dobats eat cats
' for, you see, as she couldn't answer eitherquestion, it didn't much matter which way she put it
  she feltthat she was dozing off, and had just begun to dream that shewas walking hand in hand with dinah, and saying to her veryearnestly, `now, dinah, tell me the truth:  did you ever eat abat
' when suddenly, thump
 thump
 down she came upon a heap ofsticks and dry leaves, and the fall was over
  alice was not a bit hurt, and she jumped up on to her feet in amoment:  she looked up, but it was all dark overhead; before herwas another long passage, and the white rabbit was still insight, hurrying down it
  there was not a moment to be lost:away went alice like the wind, and was just in time to hear itsay, as it turned a corner, `oh my ears and whiskers, how lateit's getting
'  she was close behind it when she turned thecorner, but the rabbit was no longer to be seen:  she foundherself in a long, low hall, which was lit up by a row of lampshanging from the roof
  there were doors all round the hall, but they were all locked;and when alice had been all the way down one side and up theother, trying every door, she walked sadly down the middle,wondering how she was ever to get out again
  suddenly she came upon a little three-legged table, all made ofsolid glass; there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key,and alice's first thought was that it might belong to one of thedoors of the hall; but, alas
 either the locks were too large, orthe key was too small, but at any rate it would not open any ofthem
  however, on the second time round, she came upon a lowcurtain she had not noticed before, and behind it was a littledoor about fifteen inches high:  she tried the little golden keyin the lock, and to her great delight it fitted
  alice opened the door and found that it led into a smallpassage, not much larger than a rat-hole:  she knelt down andlooked along the passage into the loveliest garden you ever saw
how she longed to get out of that dark hall, and wander aboutamong those beds of bright flowers and those cool fountains, butshe could not even get her head though the doorway; `and even ifmy head would go through,' thought poor alice, `it would be ofvery little use without my shoulders
  oh, how i wishi could shut up like a telescope
  i think i could, if i onlyknow how to begin
'  for, you see, so many out-of-the-way thingshad happened lately, that alice had begun to think that very fewthings indeed were really impossible
  there seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door, so shewent back to the table, half hoping she might find another key onit, or at any rate a book of rules for shutting people up liketelescopes:  this time she found a little bottle on it, (`whichcertainly was not here before,' said alice,) and round the neckof the bottle was a paper label, with the words `drink me'beautifully printed on it in large letters
  it was all very well to say `drink me,' but the wise littlealice was not going to do that in a hurry
  `no, i'll lookfirst,' she said, `and see whether it's marked "poison" or not';for she had read several nice little histories about children whohad got burnt, and eaten up by wild beasts and other unpleasantthings, all because they would not remember the simple rulestheir friends had taught them:  such as, that a red-hot pokerwill burn you if you hold it too long; and that if you cut yourfinger very deeply with a knife, it usually bleeds; and she hadnever forgotten that, if you drink much from a bottle marked`poison,' it is almost certain to disagree with you, sooner orlater
  however, this bottle was not marked `poison,' so alice venturedto taste it, and finding it very nice, (it had, in fact, a sortof mixed flavour of cherry-tart, custard, pine-apple, roastturkey, toffee, and hot buttered toast,) she very soon finishedit off
     *       *       *       *       *       *       *         *       *       *       *       *       *     *       *       *       *       *       *       *  `what a curious feeling
' said alice; `i must be shutting uplike a telescope
'  and so it was indeed:  she was now only ten inches high, andher face brightened up at the thought that she was now the rightsize for going through the little door into that lovely garden
first, however, she waited for a few minutes to see if she wasgoing to shrink any further:  she felt a little nervous aboutthis; `for it might end, you know,' said alice to herself, `in mygoing out altogether, like a candle
  i wonder what i should belike then
'  and she tried to fancy what the flame of a candle islike after the candle is blown out, for she could not rememberever having seen such a thing
  after a while, finding that nothing more happened, she decidedon going into the garden at once; but, alas for poor alice
when she got to the door, she found she had forgotten thelittle golden key, and when she went back to the table for it,she found she could not possibly reach it:  she could see itquite plainly through the glass, and she tried her best to climbup one of the legs of the table, but it was too slippery;and when she had tired herself out with trying,the poor little thing sat down and cried
  `come, there's no use in crying like that
' said alice toherself, rather sharply; `i advise you to leave off this minute
'she generally gave herself very good advice, (though she veryseldom followed it), and sometimes she scolded herself soseverely as to bring tears into her eyes; and once she rememberedtrying to box her own ears for having cheated herself in a gameof croquet she was playing against herself, for this curiouschild was very fond of pretending to be two people
  `but it's nouse now,' thought poor alice, `to pretend to be two people
  why,there's hardly enough of me left to make one respectableperson
'  soon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying underthe table:  she opened it, and found in it a very small cake, onwhich the words `eat me' were beautifully marked in currants
`well, i'll eat it,' said alice, `and if it makes me grow larger,i can reach the key; and if it makes me grow smaller, i can creepunder the door; so either way i'll get into the garden, and idon't care which happens
'  she ate a little bit, and said anxiously to herself, `whichway
  which way
', holding her hand on the top of her head tofeel which way it was growing, and she was quite surprised tofind that she remained the same size:  to be sure, this generallyhappens when one eats cake, but alice had got so much into theway of expecting nothing but out-of-the-way things to happen,that it seemed quite dull and stupid for life to go on in thecommon way
  so she set to work, and very soon finished off the cake
     *       *       *       *       *       *       *         *       *       *       *       *       *     *       *       *       *       *       *       *                           chapter ii                        the pool of tears  `curiouser and curiouser
' cried alice (she was so muchsurprised, that for the moment she quite forgot how to speak goodenglish); `now i'm opening out like the largest telescope thatever was
  good-bye, feet
' (for when she looked down at herfeet, they seemed to be almost out of sight, they were getting sofar off)
  `oh, my poor little feet, i wonder who will put onyour shoes and stockings for you now, dears
  i'm sure _i_ shan'tbe able
  i shall be a great deal too far off to trouble myselfabout you:  you must manage the best way you can; --but i must bekind to them,' thought alice, `or perhaps they won't walk theway i want to go
  let me see:  i'll give them a new pair ofboots every christmas
'  and she went on planning to herself how she would manage it
`they must go by the carrier,' she thought; `and how funny it'llseem, sending presents to one's own feet
  and how odd thedirections will look
            alice's right foot, esq
                hearthrug,                    near the fender,                        (with alice's love)
oh dear, what nonsense i'm talking
'  just then her head struck against the roof of the hall:  infact she was now more than nine feet high, and she at once tookup the little golden key and hurried off to the garden door
  poor alice
  it was as much as she could do, lying down on oneside, to look through into the garden with one eye; but to getthrough was more hopeless than ever:  she sat down and began tocry again
  `you ought to be ashamed of yourself,' said alice, `a greatgirl like you,' (she might well say this), `to go on crying inthis way
  stop this moment, i tell you
'  but she went on allthe same, shedding gallons of tears, until there was a large poolall round her, about four inches deep and reaching half down thehall
  after a time she heard a little pattering of feet in thedistance, and she hastily dried her eyes to see what was coming
it was the white rabbit returning, splendidly dressed, with apair of white kid gloves in one hand and a large fan in theother:  he came trotting along in a great hurry, muttering tohimself as he came, `oh
 the duchess, the duchess
 oh
 won't shebe savage if i've kept her waiting
'  alice felt so desperatethat she was ready to ask help of any one; so, when the rabbitcame near her, she began, in a low, timid voice, `if you please,sir--'  the rabbit started violently, dropped the white kidgloves and the fan, and skurried away into the darkness as hardas he could go
  alice took up the fan and gloves, and, as the hall was veryhot, she kept fanning herself all the time she went on talking:`dear, dear
  how queer everything is to-day
  and yesterdaythings went on just as usual
  i wonder if i've been changed inthe night
  let me think:  was i the same when i got up thismorning
  i almost think i can remember feeling a littledifferent
  but if i'm not the same, the next question is, who inthe world am i
  ah, that's the great puzzle
'  and she beganthinking over all the children she knew that were of the same ageas herself, to see if she could have been changed for any ofthem
  `i'm sure i'm not ada,' she said, `for her hair goes in suchlong ringlets, and mine doesn't go in ringlets at all; and i'msure i can't be mabel, for i know all sorts of things, and she,oh
 she knows such a very little
  besides, she's she, and i'm i,and--oh dear, how puzzling it all is
  i'll try if i know all thethings i used to know
  let me see:  four times five is twelve,and four times six is thirteen, and four times seven is--oh dear
i shall never get to twenty at that rate
  however, themultiplication table doesn't signify:  let's try geography
london is the capital of paris, and paris is the capital of rome,and rome--no, that's all wrong, i'm certain
  i must have beenchanged for mabel
  i'll try and say "how doth the little--"'and she crossed her hands on her lap as if she were saying lessons,and began to repeat it, but her voice sounded hoarse andstrange, and the words did not come the same as they used to do:--            `how doth the little crocodile              improve his shining tail,            and pour the waters of the nile              on every golden scale
            `how cheerfully he seems to grin,              how neatly spread his claws,            and welcome little fishes in              with gently smiling jaws
'  `i'm sure those are not the right words,' said poor alice, andher eyes filled with tears again as she went on, `i must be mabelafter all, and i shall have to go and live in that poky littlehouse, and have next to no toys to play with, and oh
 ever somany lessons to learn
  no, i've made up my mind about it; if i'mmabel, i'll stay down here
  it'll be no use their putting theirheads down and saying "come up again, dear
"  i shall only lookup and say "who am i then
  tell me that first, and then, if ilike being that person, i'll come up:  if not, i'll stay downhere till i'm somebody else"--but, oh dear
' cried alice, with asudden burst of tears, `i do wish they would put their headsdown
  i am so very tired of being all alone here
'  as she said this she looked down at her hands, and wassurprised to see that she had put on one of the rabbit's littlewhite kid gloves while she was talking
  `how can i have donethat
' she thought
  `i must be growing small again
'  she got upand went to the table to measure herself by it, and found that,as nearly as she could guess, she was now about two feet high,and was going on shrinking rapidly:  she soon found out that thecause of this was the fan she was holding, and she dropped ithastily, just in time to avoid shrinking away altogether
`that was a narrow escape
' said alice, a good deal frightened atthe sudden change, but very glad to find herself still inexistence; `and now for the garden
' and she ran with all speedback to the little door:  but, alas
 the little door was shutagain, and the little golden key was lying on the glass table asbefore, `and things are worse than ever,' thought the poor child,`for i never was so small as this before, never
  and i declareit's too bad, that it is
'  as she said these words her foot slipped, and in anothermoment, splash
 she was up to her chin in salt water
  her firstidea was that she had somehow fallen into the sea, `and in thatcase i can go back by railway,' she said to herself
  (alice hadbeen to the seaside once in her life, and had come to the generalconclusion, that wherever you go to on the english coast you finda number of bathing machines in the sea, some children digging inthe sand with wooden spades, then a row of lodging houses, andbehind them a railway station
)  however, she soon made out thatshe was in the pool of tears which she had wept when she was ninefeet high
  `i wish i hadn't cried so much
' said alice, as she swam about,trying to find her way out
  `i shall be punished for it now, isuppose, by being drowned in my own tears
  that will be a queerthing, to be sure
  however, everything is queer to-day
'  just then she heard something splashing about in the pool alittle way off, and she swam nearer to make out what it was:  atfirst she thought it must be a walrus or hippopotamus, but thenshe remembered how small she was now, and she soon made out thatit was only a mouse that had slipped in like herself
  `would it be of any use, now,' thought alice, `to speak to thismouse
  everything is so out-of-the-way down here, that i shouldthink very likely it can talk:  at any rate, there's no harm intrying
'  so she began:  `o mouse, do you know the way out ofthis pool
  i am very tired of swimming about here, o mouse
'(alice thought this must be the right way of speaking to a mouse:she had never done such a thing before, but she remembered havingseen in her brother's latin grammar, `a mouse--of a mouse--to amouse--a mouse--o mouse
'  the mouse looked at her ratherinquisitively, and seemed to her to wink with one of its littleeyes, but it said nothing
  `perhaps it doesn't understand english,' thought alice; `idaresay it's a french mouse, come over with william theconqueror
'  (for, with all her knowledge of history, alice hadno very clear notion how long ago anything had happened
)  so shebegan again:  `ou est ma chatte
' which was the first sentence inher french lesson-book
  the mouse gave a sudden leap out of thewater, and seemed to quiver all over with fright
  `oh, i begyour pardon
' cried alice hastily, afraid that she had hurt thepoor animal's feelings
  `i quite forgot you didn't like cats
'  `not like cats
' cried the mouse, in a shrill, passionatevoice
  `would you like cats if you were me
'  `well, perhaps not,' said alice in a soothing tone:  `don't beangry about it
  and yet i wish i could show you our cat dinah:i think you'd take a fancy to cats if you could only see her
she is such a dear quiet thing,' alice went on, half to herself,as she swam lazily about in the pool, `and she sits purring sonicely by the fire, licking her paws and washing her face--andshe is such a nice soft thing to nurse--and she's such a capitalone for catching mice--oh, i beg your pardon
' cried alice again,for this time the mouse was bristling all over, and she feltcertain it must be really offended
  `we won't talk about her anymore if you'd rather not
'  `we indeed
' cried the mouse, who was trembling down to the endof his tail
  `as if i would talk on such a subject
  our familyalways hated cats:  nasty, low, vulgar things
  don't let me hearthe name again
'  `i won't indeed
' said alice, in a great hurry to change thesubject of conversation
  `are you--are you fond--of--of dogs
'the mouse did not answer, so alice went on eagerly:  `there issuch a nice little dog near our house i should like to show you
a little bright-eyed terrier, you know, with oh, such long curlybrown hair
  and it'll fetch things when you throw them, andit'll sit up and beg for its dinner, and all sorts of things--ican't remember half of them--and it belongs to a farmer, youknow, and he says it's so useful, it's worth a hundred pounds
he says it kills all the rats and--oh dear
' cried alice in asorrowful tone, `i'm afraid i've offended it again
'  for themouse was swimming away from her as hard as it could go, andmaking quite a commotion in the pool as it went
  so she called softly after it, `mouse dear
  do come backagain, and we won't talk about cats or dogs either, if you don'tlike them
'  when the mouse heard this, it turned round and swamslowly back to her:  its face was quite pale (with passion, alicethought), and it said in a low trembling voice, `let us get tothe shore, and then i'll tell you my history, and you'llunderstand why it is i hate cats and dogs
'  it was high time to go, for the pool was getting quite crowdedwith the birds and animals that had fallen into it:  there were aduck and a dodo, a lory and an eaglet, and several other curiouscreatures
  alice led the way, and the whole party swam to theshore
                           chapter iii                  a caucus-race and a long tale  they were indeed a queer-looking party that assembled on thebank--the birds with draggled feathers, the animals with theirfur clinging close to them, and all dripping wet, cross, anduncomfortable
  the first question of course was, how to get dry again:  theyhad a consultation about this, and after a few minutes it seemedquite natural to alice to find herself talking familiarly withthem, as if she had known them all her life
  indeed, she hadquite a long argument with the lory, who at last turned sulky,and would only say, `i am older than you, and must know better';and this alice would not allow without knowing how old it was,and, as the lory positively refused to tell its age, there was nomore to be said
  at last the mouse, who seemed to be a person of authority amongthem, called out, `sit down, all of you, and listen to me
  i'llsoon make you dry enough
'  they all sat down at once, in a largering, with the mouse in the middle
  alice kept her eyesanxiously fixed on it, for she felt sure she would catch a badcold if she did not get dry very soon
  `ahem
' said the mouse with an important air, `are you all ready
this is the driest thing i know
  silence all round, if you please
"william the conqueror, whose cause was favoured by the pope, wassoon submitted to by the english, who wanted leaders, and had beenof late much accustomed to usurpation and conquest
  edwin andmorcar, the earls of mercia and northumbria--"'  `ugh
' said the lory, with a shiver
  `i beg your pardon
' said the mouse, frowning, but verypolitely:  `did you speak
'  `not i
' said the lory hastily
  `i thought you did,' said the mouse
  `--i proceed
  "edwin andmorcar, the earls of mercia and northumbria, declared for him:and even stigand, the patriotic archbishop of canterbury, foundit advisable--"'  `found what
' said the duck
  `found it,' the mouse replied rather crossly:  `of course youknow what "it" means
'  `i know what "it" means well enough, when i find a thing,' saidthe duck:  `it's generally a frog or a worm
  the question is,what did the archbishop find
'  the mouse did not notice this question, but hurriedly went on,`"--found it advisable to go with edgar atheling to meet williamand offer him the crown
  william's conduct at first wasmoderate
  but the insolence of his normans--"  how are yougetting on now, my dear
' it continued, turning to alice as itspoke
  `as wet as ever,' said alice in a melancholy tone:  `it doesn'tseem to dry me at all
'  `in that case,' said the dodo solemnly, rising to its feet, `imove that the meeting adjourn, for the immediate adoption of moreenergetic remedies--'  `speak english
' said the eaglet
  `i don't know the meaning ofhalf those long words, and, what's more, i don't believe you doeither
'  and the eaglet bent down its head to hide a smile:some of the other birds tittered audibly
  `what i was going to say,' said the dodo in an offended tone,`was, that the best thing to get us dry would be a caucus-race
'  `what is a caucus-race
' said alice; not that she wanted muchto know, but the dodo had paused as if it thought that somebodyought to speak, and no one else seemed inclined to say anything
  `why,' said the dodo, `the best way to explain it is to do it
'(and, as you might like to try the thing yourself, some winterday, i will tell you how the dodo managed it
)  first it marked out a race-course, in a sort of circle, (`theexact shape doesn't matter,' it said,) and then all the partywere placed along the course, here and there
  there was no `one,two, three, and away,' but they began running when they liked,and left off when they liked, so that it was not easy to knowwhen the race was over
  however, when they had been running halfan hour or so, and were quite dry again, the dodo suddenly calledout `the race is over
' and they all crowded round it, panting,and asking, `but who has won
'  this question the dodo could not answer without a great deal ofthought, and it sat for a long time with one finger pressed uponits forehead (the position in which you usually see shakespeare,in the pictures of him), while the rest waited in silence
  atlast the dodo said, `everybody has won, and all must haveprizes
'  `but who is to give the prizes
' quite a chorus of voicesasked
  `why, she, of course,' said the dodo, pointing to alice withone finger; and the whole party at once crowded round her,calling out in a confused way, `prizes
 prizes
'  alice had no idea what to do, and in despair she put her handin her pocket, and pulled out a box of comfits, (luckily the saltwater had not got into it), and handed them round as prizes
there was exactly one a-piece all round
  `but she must have a prize herself, you know,' said the mouse
  `of course,' the dodo replied very gravely
  `what else haveyou got in your pocket
' he went on, turning to alice
  `only a thimble,' said alice sadly
  `hand it over here,' said the dodo
  then they all crowded round her once more, while the dodosolemnly presented the thimble, saying `we beg your acceptance ofthis elegant thimble'; and, when it had finished this shortspeech, they all cheered
  alice thought the whole thing very absurd, but they all lookedso grave that she did not dare to laugh; and, as she could notthink of anything to say, she simply bowed, and took the thimble,looking as solemn as she could
  the next thing was to eat the comfits:  this caused some noiseand confusion, as the large birds complained that they could nottaste theirs, and the small ones choked and had to be patted onthe back
  however, it was over at last, and they sat down againin a ring, and begged the mouse to tell them something more
  `you promised to tell me your history, you know,' said alice,`and why it is you hate--c and d,' she added in a whisper, halfafraid that it would be offended again
  `mine is a long and a sad tale
' said the mouse, turning toalice, and sighing
  `it is a long tail, certainly,' said alice, looking down withwonder at the mouse's tail; `but why do you call it sad
'  andshe kept on puzzling about it while the mouse was speaking, sothat her idea of the tale was something like this:--                    `fury said to a                   mouse, that he                 met in the               house,            "let us              both go to                law:  i will                  prosecute                    you
  --come,                       i'll take no                        denial; we                     must have a                 trial:  for              really this           morning i've          nothing         to do
"           said the             mouse to the               cur, "such                 a trial,                   dear sir,                         with                     no jury                  or judge,                would be              wasting             our              breath
"               "i'll be                 judge, i'll                   be jury,"                         said                    cunning                      old fury:                     "i'll                      try the                         whole                          cause,                             and                        condemn                       you                      to                       death
"'  `you are not attending
' said the mouse to alice severely
`what are you thinking of
'  `i beg your pardon,' said alice very humbly:  `you had got tothe fifth bend, i think
'  `i had not
' cried the mouse, sharply and very angrily
  `a knot
' said alice, always ready to make herself useful, andlooking anxiously about her
  `oh, do let me help to undo it
'  `i shall do nothing of the sort,' said the mouse, getting upand walking away
  `you insult me by talking such nonsense
'  `i didn't mean it
' pleaded poor alice
  `but you're so easilyoffended, you know
'  the mouse only growled in reply
  `please come back and finish your story
' alice called afterit; and the others all joined in chorus, `yes, please do
' butthe mouse only shook its head impatiently, and walked a littlequicker
  `what a pity it wouldn't stay
' sighed the lory, as soon as itwas quite out of sight; and an old crab took the opportunity ofsaying to her daughter `ah, my dear
  let this be a lesson to younever to lose your temper
'  `hold your tongue, ma
' said theyoung crab, a little snappishly
  `you're enough to try thepatience of an oyster
'  `i wish i had our dinah here, i know i do
' said alice aloud,addressing nobody in particular
  `she'd soon fetch it back
'  `and who is dinah, if i might venture to ask the question
'said the lory
  alice replied eagerly, for she was always ready to talk abouther pet:  `dinah's our cat
  and she's such a capital one forcatching mice you can't think
  and oh, i wish you could see herafter the birds
  why, she'll eat a little bird as soon as lookat it
'  this speech caused a remarkable sensation among the party
some of the birds hurried off at once:  one old magpie beganwrapping itself up very carefully, remarking, `i really must begetting home; the night-air doesn't suit my throat
' and a canarycalled out in a trembling voice to its children, `come away, mydears
  it's high time you were all in bed
'  on various pretextsthey all moved off, and alice was soon left alone
  `i wish i hadn't mentioned dinah
' she said to herself in amelancholy tone
  `nobody seems to like her, down here, and i'msure she's the best cat in the world
  oh, my dear dinah
  iwonder if i shall ever see you any more
'  and here poor alicebegan to cry again, for she felt very lonely and low-spirited
in a little while, however, she again heard a little pattering offootsteps in the distance, and she looked up eagerly, half hopingthat the mouse had changed his mind, and was coming back tofinish his story
                           chapter iv                the rabbit sends in a little bill  it was the white rabbit, trotting slowly back again, andlooking anxiously about as it went, as if it had lost something;and she heard it muttering to itself `the duchess
  the duchess
oh my dear paws
  oh my fur and whiskers
  she'll get meexecuted, as sure as ferrets are ferrets
  where can i havedropped them, i wonder
'  alice guessed in a moment that it waslooking for the fan and the pair of white kid gloves, and shevery good-naturedly began hunting about for them, but they werenowhere to be seen--everything seemed to have changed since herswim in the pool, and the great hall, with the glass table andthe little door, had vanished completely
  very soon the rabbit noticed alice, as she went hunting about,and called out to her in an angry tone, `why, mary ann, what areyou doing out here
  run home this moment, and fetch me a pair ofgloves and a fan
  quick, now
'  and alice was so much frightenedthat she ran off at once in the direction it pointed to, withouttrying to explain the mistake it had made
  `he took me for his housemaid,' she said to herself as she ran
`how surprised he'll be when he finds out who i am
  but i'dbetter take him his fan and gloves--that is, if i can find them
'as she said this, she came upon a neat little house, on the doorof which was a bright brass plate with the name `w
 rabbit'engraved upon it
  she went in without knocking, and hurriedupstairs, in great fear lest she should meet the real mary ann,and be turned out of the house before she had found the fan andgloves
  `how queer it seems,' alice said to herself, `to be goingmessages for a rabbit
  i suppose dinah'll be sending me onmessages next
'  and she began fancying the sort of thing thatwould happen:  `"miss alice
  come here directly, and get readyfor your walk
" "coming in a minute, nurse
  but i've got to seethat the mouse doesn't get out
"  only i don't think,' alice wenton, `that they'd let dinah stop in the house if it began orderingpeople about like that
'  by this time she had found her way into a tidy little room witha table in the window, and on it (as she had hoped) a fan and twoor three pairs of tiny white kid gloves:  she took up the fan anda pair of the gloves, and was just going to leave the room, whenher eye fell upon a little bottle that stood near the looking-glass
  there was no label this time with the words `drink me,'but nevertheless she uncorked it and put it to her lips
  `i knowsomething interesting is sure to happen,' she said to herself,`whenever i eat or drink anything; so i'll just see what thisbottle does
  i do hope it'll make me grow large again, forreally i'm quite tired of being such a tiny little thing
'  it did so indeed, and much sooner than she had expected:before she had drunk half the bottle, she found her head pressingagainst the ceiling, and had to stoop to save her neck from beingbroken
  she hastily put down the bottle, saying to herself`that's quite enough--i hope i shan't grow any more--as it is, ican't get out at the door--i do wish i hadn't drunk quite somuch
'  alas
 it was too late to wish that
  she went on growing, andgrowing, and very soon had to kneel down on the floor:  inanother minute there was not even room for this, and she triedthe effect of lying down with one elbow against the door, and theother arm curled round her head
  still she went on growing, and,as a last resource, she put one arm out of the window, and onefoot up the chimney, and said to herself `now i can do no more,whatever happens
  what will become of me
'  luckily for alice, the little magic bottle had now had its fulleffect, and she grew no larger:  still it was very uncomfortable,and, as there seemed to be no sort of chance of her ever gettingout of the room again, no wonder she felt unhappy
  `it was much pleasanter at home,' thought poor alice, `when onewasn't always growing larger and smaller, and being ordered aboutby mice and rabbits
  i almost wish i hadn't gone down thatrabbit-hole--and yet--and yet--it's rather curious, you know,this sort of life
  i do wonder what can have happened to me
when i used to read fairy-tales, i fancied that kind of thingnever happened, and now here i am in the middle of one
  thereought to be a book written about me, that there ought
  and wheni grow up, i'll write one--but i'm grown up now,' she added in asorrowful tone; `at least there's no room to grow up any morehere
'  `but then,' thought alice, `shall i never get any older than iam now
  that'll be a comfort, one way--never to be an old woman--but then--always to have lessons to learn
  oh, i shouldn't like that
'  `oh, you foolish alice
' she answered herself
  `how can youlearn lessons in here
  why, there's hardly room for you, and noroom at all for any lesson-books
'  and so she went on, taking first one side and then the other,and making quite a conversation of it altogether; but after a fewminutes she heard a voice outside, and stopped to listen
  `mary ann
  mary ann
' said the voice
  `fetch me my glovesthis moment
'  then came a little pattering of feet on thestairs
  alice knew it was the rabbit coming to look for her, andshe trembled till she shook the house, quite forgetting that shewas now about a thousand times as large as the rabbit, and had noreason to be afraid of it
  presently the rabbit came up to the door, and tried to open it;but, as the door opened inwards, and alice's elbow was pressedhard against it, that attempt proved a failure
  alice heard itsay to itself `then i'll go round and get in at the window
'  `that you won't' thought alice, and, after waiting till shefancied she heard the rabbit just under the window, she suddenlyspread out her hand, and made a snatch in the air
  she did notget hold of anything, but she heard a little shriek and a fall,and a crash of broken glass, from which she concluded that it wasjust possible it had fallen into a cucumber-frame, or somethingof the sort
  next came an angry voice--the rabbit's--`pat
 pat
  where areyou
'  and then a voice she had never heard before, `sure theni'm here
  digging for apples, yer honour
'  `digging for apples, indeed
' said the rabbit angrily
  `here
come and help me out of this
'  (sounds of more broken glass
)  `now tell me, pat, what's that in the window
'  `sure, it's an arm, yer honour
'  (he pronounced it `arrum
')  `an arm, you goose
   who ever saw one that size
  why, itfills the whole window
'  `sure, it does, yer honour:  but it's an arm for all that
'  `well, it's got no business there, at any rate:  go and take itaway
'  there was a long silence after this, and alice could only hearwhispers now and then; such as, `sure, i don't like it, yerhonour, at all, at all
'  `do as i tell you, you coward
' and atlast she spread out her hand again, and made another snatch inthe air
  this time there were two little shrieks, and moresounds of broken glass
  `what a number of cucumber-frames theremust be
' thought alice
  `i wonder what they'll do next
  as forpulling me out of the window, i only wish they could
  i'm sure idon't want to stay in here any longer
'  she waited for some time without hearing anything more:  atlast came a rumbling of little cartwheels, and the sound of agood many voices all talking together:  she made out the words:`where's the other ladder
--why, i hadn't to bring but one;bill's got the other--bill
 fetch it here, lad
--here, put 'em upat this corner--no, tie 'em together first--they don't reach halfhigh enough yet--oh
 they'll do well enough; don't be particular--here, bill
 catch hold of this rope--will the roof bear
--mindthat loose slate--oh, it's coming down
  heads below
' (a loudcrash)--`now, who did that
--it was bill, i fancy--who's to godown the chimney
--nay, i shan't
 you do it
--that i won't,then
--bill's to go down--here, bill
 the master says you're togo down the chimney
'  `oh
 so bill's got to come down the chimney, has he
' saidalice to herself
  `shy, they seem to put everything upon bill
i wouldn't be in bill's place for a good deal:  this fireplace isnarrow, to be sure; but i think i can kick a little
'  she drew her foot as far down the chimney as she could, andwaited till she heard a little animal (she couldn't guess of whatsort it was) scratching and scrambling about in the chimney closeabove her:  then, saying to herself `this is bill,' she gave onesharp kick, and waited to see what would happen next
  the first thing she heard was a general chorus of `there goesbill
' then the rabbit's voice along--`catch him, you by thehedge
' then silence, and then another confusion of voices--`holdup his head--brandy now--don't choke him--how was it, old fellow
what happened to you
  tell us all about it
'  last came a little feeble, squeaking voice, (`that's bill,'thought alice,) `well, i hardly know--no more, thank ye; i'mbetter now--but i'm a deal too flustered to tell you--all i knowis, something comes at me like a jack-in-the-box, and up i goeslike a sky-rocket
'  `so you did, old fellow
' said the others
  `we must burn the house down
' said the rabbit's voice; andalice called out as loud as she could, `if you do
  i'll setdinah at you
'  there was a dead silence instantly, and alice thought toherself, `i wonder what they will do next
  if they had anysense, they'd take the roof off
'  after a minute or two, theybegan moving about again, and alice heard the rabbit say, `abarrowful will do, to begin with
'  `a barrowful of what
' thought alice; but she had not long todoubt, for the next moment a shower of little pebbles camerattling in at the window, and some of them hit her in the face
`i'll put a stop to this,' she said to herself, and shouted out,`you'd better not do that again
' which produced another deadsilence
  alice noticed with some surprise that the pebbles were allturning into little cakes as they lay on the floor, and a brightidea came into her head
  `if i eat one of these cakes,' shethought, `it's sure to make some change in my size; and as itcan't possibly make me larger, it must make me smaller, isuppose
'  so she swallowed one of the cakes, and was delighted to findthat she began shrinking directly
  as soon as she was smallenough to get through the door, she ran out of the house, andfound quite a crowd of little animals and birds waiting outside
the poor little lizard, bill, was in the middle, being held up bytwo guinea-pigs, who were giving it something out of a bottle
they all made a rush at alice the moment she appeared; but sheran off as hard as she could, and soon found herself safe in athick wood
  `the first thing i've got to do,' said alice to herself, as shewandered about in the wood, `is to grow to my right size again;and the second thing is to find my way into that lovely garden
i think that will be the best plan
'  it sounded an excellent plan, no doubt, and very neatly andsimply arranged; the only difficulty was, that she had not thesmallest idea how to set about it; and while she was peeringabout anxiously among the trees, a little sharp bark just overher head made her look up in a great hurry
  an enormous puppy was looking down at her with large roundeyes, and feebly stretching out one paw, trying to touch her
`poor little thing
' said alice, in a coaxing tone, and she triedhard to whistle to it; but she was terribly frightened all thetime at the thought that it might be hungry, in which case itwould be very likely to eat her up in spite of all her coaxing
  hardly knowing what she did, she picked up a little bit ofstick, and held it out to the puppy; whereupon the puppy jumpedinto the air off all its feet at once, with a yelp of delight,and rushed at the stick, and made believe to worry it; then alicedodged behind a great thistle, to keep herself from being runover; and the moment she appeared on the other side, the puppymade another rush at the stick, and tumbled head over heels inits hurry to get hold of it; then alice, thinking it was verylike having a game of play with a cart-horse, and expecting everymoment to be trampled under its feet, ran round the thistleagain; then the puppy began a series of short charges at thestick, running a very little way forwards each time and a longway back, and barking hoarsely all the while, till at last it satdown a good way off, panting, with its tongue hanging out of itsmouth, and its great eyes half shut
  this seemed to alice a good opportunity for making her escape;so she set off at once, and ran till she was quite tired and outof breath, and till the puppy's bark sounded quite faint in thedistance
  `and yet what a dear little puppy it was
' said alice, as sheleant against a buttercup to rest herself, and fanned herselfwith one of the leaves:  `i should have liked teaching it tricksvery much, if--if i'd only been the right size to do it
  ohdear
  i'd nearly forgotten that i've got to grow up again
  letme see--how is it to be managed
  i suppose i ought to eat ordrink something or other; but the great question is, what
'  the great question certainly was, what
  alice looked all roundher at the flowers and the blades of grass, but she did not seeanything that looked like the right thing to eat or drink underthe circumstances
  there was a large mushroom growing near her,about the same height as herself; and when she had looked underit, and on both sides of it, and behind it, it occurred to herthat she might as well look and see what was on the top of it
  she stretched herself up on tiptoe, and peeped over the edge ofthe mushroom, and her eyes immediately met those of a largecaterpillar, that was sitting on the top with its arms folded,quietly smoking a long hookah, and taking not the smallest noticeof her or of anything else
                            chapter v                    advice from a caterpillar  the caterpillar and alice looked at each other for some time insilence:  at last the caterpillar took the hookah out of itsmouth, and addressed her in a languid, sleepy voice
  `who are you
' said the caterpillar
  this was not an encouraging opening for a conversation
  alicereplied, rather shyly, `i--i hardly know, sir, just at present--at least i know who i was when i got up this morning, but i thinki must have been changed several times since then
'  `what do you mean by that
' said the caterpillar sternly
`explain yourself
'  `i can't explain myself, i'm afraid, sir' said alice, `becausei'm not myself, you see
'  `i don't see,' said the caterpillar
  `i'm afraid i can't put it more clearly,' alice replied verypolitely, `for i can't understand it myself to begin with; andbeing so many different sizes in a day is very confusing
'  `it isn't,' said the caterpillar
  `well, perhaps you haven't found it so yet,' said alice; `butwhen you have to turn into a chrysalis--you will some day, youknow--and then after that into a butterfly, i should think you'llfeel it a little queer, won't you
'  `not a bit,' said the caterpillar
  `well, perhaps your feelings may be different,' said alice;`all i know is, it would feel very queer to me
'  `you
' said the caterpillar contemptuously
  `who are you
'  which brought them back again to the beginning of theconversation
  alice felt a little irritated at the caterpillar'smaking such very short remarks, and she drew herself up and said,very gravely, `i think, you ought to tell me who you are, first
'  `why
' said the caterpillar
  here was another puzzling question; and as alice could notthink of any good reason, and as the caterpillar seemed to be ina very unpleasant state of mind, she turned away
  `come back
' the caterpillar called after her
  `i've somethingimportant to say
'  this sounded promising, certainly:  alice turned and came backagain
  `keep your temper,' said the caterpillar
  `is that all
' said alice, swallowing down her anger as well asshe could
  `no,' said the caterpillar
  alice thought she might as well wait, as she had nothing elseto do, and perhaps after all it might tell her something worthhearing
  for some minutes it puffed away without speaking, butat last it unfolded its arms, took the hookah out of its mouthagain, and said, `so you think you're changed, do you
'  `i'm afraid i am, sir,' said alice; `i can't remember things asi used--and i don't keep the same size for ten minutes together
'  `can't remember what things
' said the caterpillar
  `well, i've tried to say "how doth the little busy bee," but itall came different
' alice replied in a very melancholy voice
  `repeat, "you are old, father william,"' said the caterpillar
  alice folded her hands, and began:--    `you are old, father william,' the young man said,      `and your hair has become very white;    and yet you incessantly stand on your head--      do you think, at your age, it is right
'    `in my youth,' father william replied to his son,      `i feared it might injure the brain;    but, now that i'm perfectly sure i have none,      why, i do it again and again
'    `you are old,' said the youth, `as i mentioned before,      and have grown most uncommonly fat;    yet you turned a back-somersault in at the door--      pray, what is the reason of that
'    `in my youth,' said the sage, as he shook his grey locks,      `i kept all my limbs very supple    by the use of this ointment--one shilling the box--      allow me to sell you a couple
'    `you are old,' said the youth, `and your jaws are too weak      for anything tougher than suet;    yet you finished the goose, with the bones and the beak--      pray how did you manage to do it
'    `in my youth,' said his father, `i took to the law,      and argued each case with my wife;    and the muscular strength, which it gave to my jaw,      has lasted the rest of my life
'    `you are old,' said the youth, `one would hardly suppose      that your eye was as steady as ever;    yet you balanced an eel on the end of your nose--      what made you so awfully clever
'    `i have answered three questions, and that is enough,'      said his father; `don't give yourself airs
    do you think i can listen all day to such stuff
      be off, or i'll kick you down stairs
'  `that is not said right,' said the caterpillar
  `not quite right, i'm afraid,' said alice, timidly; `some of thewords have got altered
'  `it is wrong from beginning to end,' said the caterpillardecidedly, and there was silence for some minutes
  the caterpillar was the first to speak
  `what size do you want to be
' it asked
  `oh, i'm not particular as to size,' alice hastily replied;`only one doesn't like changing so often, you know
'  `i don't know,' said the caterpillar
  alice said nothing:  she had never been so much contradicted inher life before, and she felt that she was losing her temper
  `are you content now
' said the caterpillar
  `well, i should like to be a little larger, sir, if youwouldn't mind,' said alice:  `three inches is such a wretchedheight to be
'  `it is a very good height indeed
' said the caterpillarangrily, rearing itself upright as it spoke (it was exactly threeinches high)
  `but i'm not used to it
' pleaded poor alice in a piteous tone
and she thought of herself, `i wish the creatures wouldn't be soeasily offended
'  `you'll get used to it in time,' said the caterpillar; and itput the hookah into its mouth and began smoking again
  this time alice waited patiently until it chose to speak again
in a minute or two the caterpillar took the hookah out of itsmouth and yawned once or twice, and shook itself
  then it gotdown off the mushroom, and crawled away in the grass, merelyremarking as it went, `one side will make you grow taller, andthe other side will make you grow shorter
'  `one side of what
  the other side of what
' thought alice toherself
  `of the mushroom,' said the caterpillar, just as if she hadasked it aloud; and in another moment it was out of sight
  alice remained looking thoughtfully at the mushroom for aminute, trying to make out which were the two sides of it; and asit was perfectly round, she found this a very difficult question
however, at last she stretched her arms round it as far as theywould go, and broke off a bit of the edge with each hand
  `and now which is which
' she said to herself, and nibbled alittle of the right-hand bit to try the effect:  the next momentshe felt a violent blow underneath her chin:  it had struck herfoot
  she was a good deal frightened by this very sudden change, butshe felt that there was no time to be lost, as she was shrinkingrapidly; so she set to work at once to eat some of the other bit
her chin was pressed so closely against her foot, that there washardly room to open her mouth; but she did it at last, andmanaged to swallow a morsel of the lefthand bit
     *       *       *       *       *       *       *         *       *       *       *       *       *     *       *       *       *       *       *       *  `come, my head's free at last
' said alice in a tone ofdelight, which changed into alarm in another moment, when shefound that her shoulders were nowhere to be found:  all she couldsee, when she looked down, was an immense length of neck, whichseemed to rise like a stalk out of a sea of green leaves that layfar below her
  `what can all that green stuff be
' said alice
  `and wherehave my shoulders got to
