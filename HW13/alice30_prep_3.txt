'  `it's a mineral, i think,' said alice
  `of course it is,' said the duchess, who seemed ready to agreeto everything that alice said; `there's a large mustard-mine nearhere
  and the moral of that is--"the more there is of mine, theless there is of yours
"'  `oh, i know
' exclaimed alice, who had not attended to thislast remark, `it's a vegetable
  it doesn't look like one, but itis
'  `i quite agree with you,' said the duchess; `and the moral ofthat is--"be what you would seem to be"--or if you'd like it putmore simply--"never imagine yourself not to be otherwise thanwhat it might appear to others that what you were or might havebeen was not otherwise than what you had been would have appearedto them to be otherwise
"'  `i think i should understand that better,' alice said verypolitely, `if i had it written down:  but i can't quite follow itas you say it
'  `that's nothing to what i could say if i chose,' the duchessreplied, in a pleased tone
  `pray don't trouble yourself to say it any longer than that,'said alice
  `oh, don't talk about trouble
' said the duchess
  `i make youa present of everything i've said as yet
'  `a cheap sort of present
' thought alice
  `i'm glad they don'tgive birthday presents like that
'  but she did not venture tosay it out loud
  `thinking again
' the duchess asked, with another dig of hersharp little chin
  `i've a right to think,' said alice sharply, for she wasbeginning to feel a little worried
  `just about as much right,' said the duchess, `as pigs have to fly;and the m--'  but here, to alice's great surprise, the duchess's voice diedaway, even in the middle of her favourite word `moral,' and thearm that was linked into hers began to tremble
  alice looked up,and there stood the queen in front of them, with her arms folded,frowning like a thunderstorm
  `a fine day, your majesty
' the duchess began in a low, weakvoice
  `now, i give you fair warning,' shouted the queen, stamping onthe ground as she spoke; `either you or your head must be off,and that in about half no time
  take your choice
'  the duchess took her choice, and was gone in a moment
  `let's go on with the game,' the queen said to alice; and alicewas too much frightened to say a word, but slowly followed herback to the croquet-ground
  the other guests had taken advantage of the queen's absence,and were resting in the shade:  however, the moment they saw her,they hurried back to the game, the queen merely remarking that amoment's delay would cost them their lives
  all the time they were playing the queen never left offquarrelling with the other players, and shouting `off with hishead
' or `off with her head
'  those whom she sentenced weretaken into custody by the soldiers, who of course had to leaveoff being arches to do this, so that by the end of half an houror so there were no arches left, and all the players, except theking, the queen, and alice, were in custody and under sentence ofexecution
  then the queen left off, quite out of breath, and said toalice, `have you seen the mock turtle yet
'  `no,' said alice
  `i don't even know what a mock turtle is
'  `it's the thing mock turtle soup is made from,' said the queen
  `i never saw one, or heard of one,' said alice
  `come on, then,' said the queen, `and he shall tell you hishistory,'  as they walked off together, alice heard the king say in a lowvoice, to the company generally, `you are all pardoned
'  `come,that's a good thing
' she said to herself, for she had felt quiteunhappy at the number of executions the queen had ordered
  they very soon came upon a gryphon, lying fast asleep in thesun
  (if you don't know what a gryphon is, look at the picture
)`up, lazy thing
' said the queen, `and take this young lady tosee the mock turtle, and to hear his history
  i must go back andsee after some executions i have ordered'; and she walked off,leaving alice alone with the gryphon
  alice did not quite likethe look of the creature, but on the whole she thought it wouldbe quite as safe to stay with it as to go after that savagequeen:  so she waited
  the gryphon sat up and rubbed its eyes:  then it watched thequeen till she was out of sight:  then it chuckled
  `what fun
'said the gryphon, half to itself, half to alice
  `what is the fun
' said alice
  `why, she,' said the gryphon
  `it's all her fancy, that:  theynever executes nobody, you know
  come on
'  `everybody says "come on
" here,' thought alice, as she wentslowly after it:  `i never was so ordered about in all my life,never
'  they had not gone far before they saw the mock turtle in thedistance, sitting sad and lonely on a little ledge of rock, and,as they came nearer, alice could hear him sighing as if his heartwould break
  she pitied him deeply
  `what is his sorrow
' sheasked the gryphon, and the gryphon answered, very nearly in thesame words as before, `it's all his fancy, that:  he hasn't gotno sorrow, you know
  come on
'  so they went up to the mock turtle, who looked at them withlarge eyes full of tears, but said nothing
  `this here young lady,' said the gryphon, `she wants for toknow your history, she do
'  `i'll tell it her,' said the mock turtle in a deep, hollowtone:  `sit down, both of you, and don't speak a word till i'vefinished
'  so they sat down, and nobody spoke for some minutes
  alicethought to herself, `i don't see how he can even finish, if hedoesn't begin
'  but she waited patiently
  `once,' said the mock turtle at last, with a deep sigh, `i wasa real turtle
'  these words were followed by a very long silence, broken onlyby an occasional exclamation of `hjckrrh
' from the gryphon, andthe constant heavy sobbing of the mock turtle
  alice was verynearly getting up and saying, `thank you, sir, for yourinteresting story,' but she could not help thinking there must bemore to come, so she sat still and said nothing
  `when we were little,' the mock turtle went on at last, morecalmly, though still sobbing a little now and then, `we went toschool in the sea
  the master was an old turtle--we used to callhim tortoise--'  `why did you call him tortoise, if he wasn't one
' alice asked
  `we called him tortoise because he taught us,' said the mockturtle angrily:  `really you are very dull
'  `you ought to be ashamed of yourself for asking such a simplequestion,' added the gryphon; and then they both sat silent andlooked at poor alice, who felt ready to sink into the earth
  atlast the gryphon said to the mock turtle, `drive on, old fellow
don't be all day about it
' and he went on in these words:  `yes, we went to school in the sea, though you mayn't believeit--'  `i never said i didn't
' interrupted alice
  `you did,' said the mock turtle
  `hold your tongue
' added the gryphon, before alice could speakagain
  the mock turtle went on
  `we had the best of educations--in fact, we went to schoolevery day--'  `i've been to a day-school, too,' said alice; `you needn't beso proud as all that
'  `with extras
' asked the mock turtle a little anxiously
  `yes,' said alice, `we learned french and music
'  `and washing
' said the mock turtle
  `certainly not
' said alice indignantly
  `ah
 then yours wasn't a really good school,' said the mockturtle in a tone of great relief
  `now at ours they had at theend of the bill, "french, music, and washing--extra
"'  `you couldn't have wanted it much,' said alice; `living at thebottom of the sea
'  `i couldn't afford to learn it
' said the mock turtle with asigh
  `i only took the regular course
'  `what was that
' inquired alice
  `reeling and writhing, of course, to begin with,' the mockturtle replied; `and then the different branches of arithmetic--ambition, distraction, uglification, and derision
'  `i never heard of "uglification,"' alice ventured to say
  `what is it
'  the gryphon lifted up both its paws in surprise
  `what
  neverheard of uglifying
' it exclaimed
  `you know what to beautify is,i suppose
'  `yes,' said alice doubtfully:  `it means--to--make--anything--prettier
'  `well, then,' the gryphon went on, `if you don't know what touglify is, you are a simpleton
'  alice did not feel encouraged to ask any more questions aboutit, so she turned to the mock turtle, and said `what else had youto learn
'  `well, there was mystery,' the mock turtle replied, countingoff the subjects on his flappers, `--mystery, ancient and modern,with seaography:  then drawling--the drawling-master was an oldconger-eel, that used to come once a week:  he taught usdrawling, stretching, and fainting in coils
'  `what was that like
' said alice
  `well, i can't show it you myself,' the mock turtle said:  `i'mtoo stiff
  and the gryphon never learnt it
'  `hadn't time,' said the gryphon:  `i went to the classicsmaster, though
  he was an old crab, he was
'  `i never went to him,' the mock turtle said with a sigh:  `hetaught laughing and grief, they used to say
'  `so he did, so he did,' said the gryphon, sighing in his turn;and both creatures hid their faces in their paws
  `and how many hours a day did you do lessons
' said alice, in ahurry to change the subject
  `ten hours the first day,' said the mock turtle: `nine thenext, and so on
'  `what a curious plan
' exclaimed alice
  `that's the reason they're called lessons,' the gryphonremarked:  `because they lessen from day to day
'  this was quite a new idea to alice, and she thought it over alittle before she made her next remark
  `then the eleventh daymust have been a holiday
'  `of course it was,' said the mock turtle
  `and how did you manage on the twelfth
' alice went on eagerly
  `that's enough about lessons,' the gryphon interrupted in avery decided tone:  `tell her something about the games now
'                            chapter x                      the lobster quadrille  the mock turtle sighed deeply, and drew the back of one flapperacross his eyes
  he looked at alice, and tried to speak, but fora minute or two sobs choked his voice
  `same as if he had a bonein his throat,' said the gryphon:  and it set to work shaking himand punching him in the back
  at last the mock turtle recoveredhis voice, and, with tears running down his cheeks, he went onagain:--  `you may not have lived much under the sea--' (`i haven't,' said alice)--`and perhaps you were never even introduced to a lobster--'(alice began to say `i once tasted--' but checked herself hastily,and said `no, never') `--so you can have no idea what a delightfulthing a lobster quadrille is
'  `no, indeed,' said alice
  `what sort of a dance is it
'  `why,' said the gryphon, `you first form into a line along the sea-shore--'  `two lines
' cried the mock turtle
  `seals, turtles, salmon, and so on;then, when you've cleared all the jelly-fish out of the way--'  `that generally takes some time,' interrupted the gryphon
  `--you advance twice--'  `each with a lobster as a partner
' cried the gryphon
  `of course,' the mock turtle said:  `advance twice, set topartners--'  `--change lobsters, and retire in same order,' continued thegryphon
  `then, you know,' the mock turtle went on, `you throw the--'  `the lobsters
' shouted the gryphon, with a bound into the air
  `--as far out to sea as you can--'  `swim after them
' screamed the gryphon
  `turn a somersault in the sea
' cried the mock turtle,capering wildly about
  `change lobster's again
' yelled the gryphon at the top of its voice
  `back to land again, and that's all the first figure,' said themock turtle, suddenly dropping his voice; and the two creatures,who had been jumping about like mad things all this time, satdown again very sadly and quietly, and looked at alice
  `it must be a very pretty dance,' said alice timidly
  `would you like to see a little of it
' said the mock turtle
  `very much indeed,' said alice
  `come, let's try the first figure
' said the mock turtle to thegryphon
  `we can do without lobsters, you know
  which shallsing
'  `oh, you sing,' said the gryphon
  `i've forgotten the words
'  so they began solemnly dancing round and round alice, every nowand then treading on her toes when they passed too close, andwaving their forepaws to mark the time, while the mock turtlesang this, very slowly and sadly:--`"will you walk a little faster
" said a whiting to a snail
"there's a porpoise close behind us, and he's treading on my tail
see how eagerly the lobsters and the turtles all advance
they are waiting on the shingle--will you come and join thedance
will you, won't you, will you, won't you, will you join thedance
will you, won't you, will you, won't you, won't you join thedance
"you can really have no notion how delightful it will bewhen they take us up and throw us, with the lobsters, out to                                                      sea
"but the snail replied "too far, too far
" and gave a look                                                       askance--said he thanked the whiting kindly, but he would not join the   dance
    would not, could not, would not, could not, would not join        the dance
    would not, could not, would not, could not, could not join        the dance
`"what matters it how far we go
" his scaly friend replied
"there is another shore, you know, upon the other side
the further off from england the nearer is to france--then turn not pale, beloved snail, but come and join the dance
    will you, won't you, will you, won't you, will you join the         dance
    will you, won't you, will you, won't you, won't you join the         dance
"'  `thank you, it's a very interesting dance to watch,' saidalice, feeling very glad that it was over at last:  `and i do solike that curious song about the whiting
'  `oh, as to the whiting,' said the mock turtle, `they--you'veseen them, of course
'  `yes,' said alice, `i've often seen them at dinn--' shechecked herself hastily
  `i don't know where dinn may be,' said the mock turtle, `butif you've seen them so often, of course you know what they'relike
'  `i believe so,' alice replied thoughtfully
  `they have theirtails in their mouths--and they're all over crumbs
'  `you're wrong about the crumbs,' said the mock turtle:`crumbs would all wash off in the sea
  but they have their tailsin their mouths; and the reason is--' here the mock turtleyawned and shut his eyes
--`tell her about the reason and allthat,' he said to the gryphon
  `the reason is,' said the gryphon, `that they would go withthe lobsters to the dance
  so they got thrown out to sea
  sothey had to fall a long way
  so they got their tails fast intheir mouths
  so they couldn't get them out again
  that's all
'  `thank you,' said alice, `it's very interesting
  i never knewso much about a whiting before
'  `i can tell you more than that, if you like,' said thegryphon
  `do you know why it's called a whiting
'  `i never thought about it,' said alice
  `why
'  `it does the boots and shoes
' the gryphon replied verysolemnly
  alice was thoroughly puzzled
  `does the boots and shoes
' sherepeated in a wondering tone
  `why, what are your shoes done with
' said the gryphon
  `imean, what makes them so shiny
'  alice looked down at them, and considered a little before shegave her answer
  `they're done with blacking, i believe
'  `boots and shoes under the sea,' the gryphon went on in a deepvoice, `are done with a whiting
  now you know
'  `and what are they made of
' alice asked in a tone of greatcuriosity
  `soles and eels, of course,' the gryphon replied ratherimpatiently:  `any shrimp could have told you that
'  `if i'd been the whiting,' said alice, whose thoughts werestill running on the song, `i'd have said to the porpoise, "keepback, please:  we don't want you with us
"'  `they were obliged to have him with them,' the mock turtlesaid:  `no wise fish would go anywhere without a porpoise
'  `wouldn't it really
' said alice in a tone of great surprise
  `of course not,' said the mock turtle:  `why, if a fish cameto me, and told me he was going a journey, i should say "withwhat porpoise
"'  `don't you mean "purpose"
' said alice
  `i mean what i say,' the mock turtle replied in an offendedtone
  and the gryphon added `come, let's hear some of youradventures
'  `i could tell you my adventures--beginning from this morning,'said alice a little timidly:  `but it's no use going back toyesterday, because i was a different person then
'  `explain all that,' said the mock turtle
  `no, no
  the adventures first,' said the gryphon in animpatient tone:  `explanations take such a dreadful time
'  so alice began telling them her adventures from the time whenshe first saw the white rabbit
  she was a little nervous aboutit just at first, the two creatures got so close to her, one oneach side, and opened their eyes and mouths so very wide, but shegained courage as she went on
  her listeners were perfectlyquiet till she got to the part about her repeating `you are old,father william,' to the caterpillar, and the words all comingdifferent, and then the mock turtle drew a long breath, and said`that's very curious
'  `it's all about as curious as it can be,' said the gryphon
  `it all came different
' the mock turtle repeatedthoughtfully
  `i should like to hear her try and repeatsomething now
  tell her to begin
'  he looked at the gryphon asif he thought it had some kind of authority over alice
  `stand up and repeat "'tis the voice of the sluggard,"' saidthe gryphon
  `how the creatures order one about, and make one repeatlessons
' thought alice; `i might as well be at school at once
'however, she got up, and began to repeat it, but her head was sofull of the lobster quadrille, that she hardly knew what she wassaying, and the words came very queer indeed:--    `'tis the voice of the lobster; i heard him declare,    "you have baked me too brown, i must sugar my hair
"    as a duck with its eyelids, so he with his nose    trims his belt and his buttons, and turns out his toes
'              [later editions continued as follows    when the sands are all dry, he is gay as a lark,    and will talk in contemptuous tones of the shark,    but, when the tide rises and sharks are around,    his voice has a timid and tremulous sound
]  `that's different from what i used to say when i was a child,'said the gryphon
  `well, i never heard it before,' said the mock turtle; `but itsounds uncommon nonsense
'  alice said nothing; she had sat down with her face in herhands, wondering if anything would ever happen in a natural wayagain
  `i should like to have it explained,' said the mock turtle
  `she can't explain it,' said the gryphon hastily
  `go on withthe next verse
'  `but about his toes
' the mock turtle persisted
  `how couldhe turn them out with his nose, you know
'  `it's the first position in dancing
' alice said; but wasdreadfully puzzled by the whole thing, and longed to change thesubject
  `go on with the next verse,' the gryphon repeated impatiently:`it begins "i passed by his garden
"'  alice did not dare to disobey, though she felt sure it wouldall come wrong, and she went on in a trembling voice:--    `i passed by his garden, and marked, with one eye,    how the owl and the panther were sharing a pie--'        [later editions continued as follows    the panther took pie-crust, and gravy, and meat,    while the owl had the dish as its share of the treat
    when the pie was all finished, the owl, as a boon,    was kindly permitted to pocket the spoon:    while the panther received knife and fork with a growl,    and concluded the banquet--]  `what is the use of repeating all that stuff,' the mock turtleinterrupted, `if you don't explain it as you go on
  it's by farthe most confusing thing i ever heard
'  `yes, i think you'd better leave off,' said the gryphon:  andalice was only too glad to do so
  `shall we try another figure of the lobster quadrille
' thegryphon went on
  `or would you like the mock turtle to sing youa song
'  `oh, a song, please, if the mock turtle would be so kind,'alice replied, so eagerly that the gryphon said, in a ratheroffended tone, `hm
  no accounting for tastes
  sing her"turtle soup," will you, old fellow
'  the mock turtle sighed deeply, and began, in a voice sometimeschoked with sobs, to sing this:--    `beautiful soup, so rich and green,    waiting in a hot tureen
    who for such dainties would not stoop
    soup of the evening, beautiful soup
    soup of the evening, beautiful soup
        beau--ootiful soo--oop
        beau--ootiful soo--oop
    soo--oop of the e--e--evening,        beautiful, beautiful soup
    `beautiful soup
  who cares for fish,    game, or any other dish
    who would not give all else for two p    ennyworth only of beautiful soup
    pennyworth only of beautiful soup
        beau--ootiful soo--oop
        beau--ootiful soo--oop
    soo--oop of the e--e--evening,        beautiful, beauti--ful soup
'  `chorus again
' cried the gryphon, and the mock turtle hadjust begun to repeat it, when a cry of `the trial's beginning
'was heard in the distance
  `come on
' cried the gryphon, and, taking alice by the hand,it hurried off, without waiting for the end of the song
  `what trial is it
' alice panted as she ran; but the gryphononly answered `come on
' and ran the faster, while more and morefaintly came, carried on the breeze that followed them, themelancholy words:--    `soo--oop of the e--e--evening,        beautiful, beautiful soup
'                           chapter xi                      who stole the tarts
  the king and queen of hearts were seated on their throne whenthey arrived, with a great crowd assembled about them--all sortsof little birds and beasts, as well as the whole pack of cards:the knave was standing before them, in chains, with a soldier oneach side to guard him; and near the king was the white rabbit,with a trumpet in one hand, and a scroll of parchment in theother
  in the very middle of the court was a table, with a largedish of tarts upon it:  they looked so good, that it made alicequite hungry to look at them--`i wish they'd get the trial done,'she thought, `and hand round the refreshments
'  but there seemedto be no chance of this, so she began looking at everything abouther, to pass away the time
  alice had never been in a court of justice before, but she hadread about them in books, and she was quite pleased to find thatshe knew the name of nearly everything there
  `that's thejudge,' she said to herself, `because of his great wig
'  the judge, by the way, was the king; and as he wore his crownover the wig, (look at the frontispiece if you want to see how hedid it,) he did not look at all comfortable, and it was certainlynot becoming
  `and that's the jury-box,' thought alice, `and those twelvecreatures,' (she was obliged to say `creatures,' you see, becausesome of them were animals, and some were birds,) `i suppose theyare the jurors
'  she said this last word two or three times overto herself, being rather proud of it:  for she thought, andrightly too, that very few little girls of her age knew themeaning of it at all
  however, `jury-men' would have done justas well
  the twelve jurors were all writing very busily on slates
`what are they doing
'  alice whispered to the gryphon
  `theycan't have anything to put down yet, before the trial's begun
'  `they're putting down their names,' the gryphon whispered inreply, `for fear they should forget them before the end of thetrial
'  `stupid things
' alice began in a loud, indignant voice, butshe stopped hastily, for the white rabbit cried out, `silence inthe court
' and the king put on his spectacles and lookedanxiously round, to make out who was talking
  alice could see, as well as if she were looking over theirshoulders, that all the jurors were writing down `stupid things
'on their slates, and she could even make out that one of themdidn't know how to spell `stupid,' and that he had to ask hisneighbour to tell him
  `a nice muddle their slates'll be inbefore the trial's over
' thought alice
  one of the jurors had a pencil that squeaked
  this of course,alice could not stand, and she went round the court and gotbehind him, and very soon found an opportunity of taking itaway
  she did it so quickly that the poor little juror (it wasbill, the lizard) could not make out at all what had become ofit; so, after hunting all about for it, he was obliged to writewith one finger for the rest of the day; and this was of verylittle use, as it left no mark on the slate
  `herald, read the accusation
' said the king
  on this the white rabbit blew three blasts on the trumpet, andthen unrolled the parchment scroll, and read as follows:--    `the queen of hearts, she made some tarts,          all on a summer day:      the knave of hearts, he stole those tarts,          and took them quite away
'  `consider your verdict,' the king said to the jury
  `not yet, not yet
' the rabbit hastily interrupted
  `there'sa great deal to come before that
'  `call the first witness,' said the king; and the white rabbitblew three blasts on the trumpet, and called out, `firstwitness
'  the first witness was the hatter
  he came in with a teacup inone hand and a piece of bread-and-butter in the other
  `i begpardon, your majesty,' he began, `for bringing these in:  but ihadn't quite finished my tea when i was sent for
'  `you ought to have finished,' said the king
  `when did youbegin
'  the hatter looked at the march hare, who had followed him intothe court, arm-in-arm with the dormouse
  `fourteenth of march, ithink it was,' he said
  `fifteenth,' said the march hare
  `sixteenth,' added the dormouse
  `write that down,' the king said to the jury, and the juryeagerly wrote down all three dates on their slates, and thenadded them up, and reduced the answer to shillings and pence
  `take off your hat,' the king said to the hatter
  `it isn't mine,' said the hatter
  `stolen
' the king exclaimed, turning to the jury, whoinstantly made a memorandum of the fact
  `i keep them to sell,' the hatter added as an explanation;`i've none of my own
  i'm a hatter
'  here the queen put on her spectacles, and began staring at thehatter, who turned pale and fidgeted
  `give your evidence,' said the king; `and don't be nervous, ori'll have you executed on the spot
'  this did not seem to encourage the witness at all:  he keptshifting from one foot to the other, looking uneasily at thequeen, and in his confusion he bit a large piece out of histeacup instead of the bread-and-butter
  just at this moment alice felt a very curious sensation, whichpuzzled her a good deal until she made out what it was:  she wasbeginning to grow larger again, and she thought at first shewould get up and leave the court; but on second thoughts shedecided to remain where she was as long as there was room forher
  `i wish you wouldn't squeeze so
' said the dormouse, who wassitting next to her
  `i can hardly breathe
'  `i can't help it,' said alice very meekly:  `i'm growing
'  `you've no right to grow here,' said the dormouse
  `don't talk nonsense,' said alice more boldly:  `you knowyou're growing too
'  `yes, but i grow at a reasonable pace,' said the dormouse:`not in that ridiculous fashion
'  and he got up very sulkilyand crossed over to the other side of the court
  all this time the queen had never left off staring at thehatter, and, just as the dormouse crossed the court, she said toone of the officers of the court, `bring me the list of thesingers in the last concert
' on which the wretched hattertrembled so, that he shook both his shoes off
  `give your evidence,' the king repeated angrily, `or i'll haveyou executed, whether you're nervous or not
'  `i'm a poor man, your majesty,' the hatter began, in atrembling voice, `--and i hadn't begun my tea--not above a weekor so--and what with the bread-and-butter getting so thin--andthe twinkling of the tea--'  `the twinkling of the what
' said the king
  `it began with the tea,' the hatter replied
  `of course twinkling begins with a t
' said the king sharply
`do you take me for a dunce
  go on
'  `i'm a poor man,' the hatter went on, `and most thingstwinkled after that--only the march hare said--'  `i didn't
' the march hare interrupted in a great hurry
  `you did
' said the hatter
  `i deny it
' said the march hare
  `he denies it,' said the king:  `leave out that part
'  `well, at any rate, the dormouse said--' the hatter went on,looking anxiously round to see if he would deny it too:  but thedormouse denied nothing, being fast asleep
  `after that,' continued the hatter, `i cut some more bread-and-butter--'  `but what did the dormouse say
' one of the jury asked
  `that i can't remember,' said the hatter
  `you must remember,' remarked the king, `or i'll have youexecuted
'  the miserable hatter dropped his teacup and bread-and-butter,and went down on one knee
  `i'm a poor man, your majesty,' hebegan
  `you're a very poor speaker,' said the king
  here one of the guinea-pigs cheered, and was immediatelysuppressed by the officers of the court
  (as that is rather ahard word, i will just explain to you how it was done
  they hada large canvas bag, which tied up at the mouth with strings:into this they slipped the guinea-pig, head first, and then satupon it
)  `i'm glad i've seen that done,' thought alice
  `i've so oftenread in the newspapers, at the end of trials, "there was someattempts at applause, which was immediately suppressed by theofficers of the court," and i never understood what it meanttill now
'  `if that's all you know about it, you may stand down,'continued the king
  `i can't go no lower,' said the hatter:  `i'm on the floor, asit is
'  `then you may sit down,' the king replied
  here the other guinea-pig cheered, and was suppressed
  `come, that finished the guinea-pigs
' thought alice
  `now weshall get on better
'  `i'd rather finish my tea,' said the hatter, with an anxiouslook at the queen, who was reading the list of singers
  `you may go,' said the king, and the hatter hurriedly left thecourt, without even waiting to put his shoes on
  `--and just take his head off outside,' the queen added to oneof the officers:  but the hatter was out of sight before theofficer could get to the door
  `call the next witness
' said the king
  the next witness was the duchess's cook
  she carried thepepper-box in her hand, and alice guessed who it was, even beforeshe got into the court, by the way the people near the door begansneezing all at once
  `give your evidence,' said the king
  `shan't,' said the cook
  the king looked anxiously at the white rabbit, who said in alow voice, `your majesty must cross-examine this witness
'  `well, if i must, i must,' the king said, with a melancholyair, and, after folding his arms and frowning at the cook tillhis eyes were nearly out of sight, he said in a deep voice, `whatare tarts made of
'  `pepper, mostly,' said the cook
  `treacle,' said a sleepy voice behind her
  `collar that dormouse,' the queen shrieked out
  `behead thatdormouse
  turn that dormouse out of court
  suppress him
  pinchhim
  off with his whiskers
'  for some minutes the whole court was in confusion, getting thedormouse turned out, and, by the time they had settled downagain, the cook had disappeared
  `never mind
' said the king, with an air of great relief
`call the next witness
'  and he added in an undertone to thequeen, `really, my dear, you must cross-examine the next witness
it quite makes my forehead ache
'  alice watched the white rabbit as he fumbled over the list,feeling very curious to see what the next witness would be like,`--for they haven't got much evidence yet,' she said to herself
imagine her surprise, when the white rabbit read out, at the topof his shrill little voice, the name `alice
'                           chapter xii                        alice's evidence  `here
' cried alice, quite forgetting in the flurry of themoment how large she had grown in the last few minutes, and shejumped up in such a hurry that she tipped over the jury-box withthe edge of her skirt, upsetting all the jurymen on to the headsof the crowd below, and there they lay sprawling about, remindingher very much of a globe of goldfish she had accidentally upsetthe week before
  `oh, i beg your pardon
' she exclaimed in a tone of greatdismay, and began picking them up again as quickly as she could,for the accident of the goldfish kept running in her head, andshe had a vague sort of idea that they must be collected at onceand put back into the jury-box, or they would die
  `the trial cannot proceed,' said the king in a very gravevoice, `until all the jurymen are back in their proper places--all,' he repeated with great emphasis, looking hard at alice ashe said do
  alice looked at the jury-box, and saw that, in her haste, shehad put the lizard in head downwards, and the poor little thingwas waving its tail about in a melancholy way, being quite unableto move
  she soon got it out again, and put it right; `not thatit signifies much,' she said to herself; `i should think itwould be quite as much use in the trial one way up as the other
'  as soon as the jury had a little recovered from the shock ofbeing upset, and their slates and pencils had been found andhanded back to them, they set to work very diligently to writeout a history of the accident, all except the lizard, who seemedtoo much overcome to do anything but sit with its mouth open,gazing up into the roof of the court
  `what do you know about this business
' the king said toalice
  `nothing,' said alice
  `nothing whatever
' persisted the king
  `nothing whatever,' said alice
  `that's very important,' the king said, turning to the jury
they were just beginning to write this down on their slates, whenthe white rabbit interrupted:  `unimportant, your majesty means,of course,' he said in a very respectful tone, but frowning andmaking faces at him as he spoke
  `unimportant, of course, i meant,' the king hastily said, andwent on to himself in an undertone, `important--unimportant--unimportant--important--' as if he were trying which wordsounded best
  some of the jury wrote it down `important,' and some`unimportant
'  alice could see this, as she was near enough tolook over their slates; `but it doesn't matter a bit,' shethought to herself
  at this moment the king, who had been for some time busilywriting in his note-book, cackled out `silence
' and read outfrom his book, `rule forty-two
  all persons more than a milehigh to leave the court
'  everybody looked at alice
  `i'm not a mile high,' said alice
  `you are,' said the king
  `nearly two miles high,' added the queen
  `well, i shan't go, at any rate,' said alice:  `besides,that's not a regular rule:  you invented it just now
'  `it's the oldest rule in the book,' said the king
  `then it ought to be number one,' said alice
  the king turned pale, and shut his note-book hastily
`consider your verdict,' he said to the jury, in a low, tremblingvoice
  `there's more evidence to come yet, please your majesty,' saidthe white rabbit, jumping up in a great hurry; `this paper hasjust been picked up
'  `what's in it
' said the queen
  `i haven't opened it yet,' said the white rabbit, `but it seemsto be a letter, written by the prisoner to--to somebody
'  `it must have been that,' said the king, `unless it waswritten to nobody, which isn't usual, you know
'  `who is it directed to
' said one of the jurymen
  `it isn't directed at all,' said the white rabbit; `in fact,there's nothing written on the outside
'  he unfolded the paperas he spoke, and added `it isn't a letter, after all:  it's a setof verses
'  `are they in the prisoner's handwriting
' asked another ofthey jurymen
  `no, they're not,' said the white rabbit, `and that's thequeerest thing about it
'  (the jury all looked puzzled
)  `he must have imitated somebody else's hand,' said the king
(the jury all brightened up again
)  `please your majesty,' said the knave, `i didn't write it, andthey can't prove i did:  there's no name signed at the end
'  `if you didn't sign it,' said the king, `that only makes thematter worse
  you must have meant some mischief, or else you'dhave signed your name like an honest man
'  there was a general clapping of hands at this:  it was thefirst really clever thing the king had said that day
  `that proves his guilt,' said the queen
  `it proves nothing of the sort
' said alice
  `why, you don'teven know what they're about
'  `read them,' said the king
  the white rabbit put on his spectacles
  `where shall i begin,please your majesty
' he asked
  `begin at the beginning,' the king said gravely, `and go ontill you come to the end:  then stop
'  these were the verses the white rabbit read:--        `they told me you had been to her,          and mentioned me to him:        she gave me a good character,          but said i could not swim
        he sent them word i had not gone          (we know it to be true):        if she should push the matter on,          what would become of you
        i gave her one, they gave him two,          you gave us three or more;        they all returned from him to you,          though they were mine before
        if i or she should chance to be          involved in this affair,        he trusts to you to set them free,          exactly as we were
        my notion was that you had been          (before she had this fit)        an obstacle that came between          him, and ourselves, and it
        don't let him know she liked them best,          for this must ever be        a secret, kept from all the rest,          between yourself and me
'  `that's the most important piece of evidence we've heard yet,'said the king, rubbing his hands; `so now let the jury--'  `if any one of them can explain it,' said alice, (she hadgrown so large in the last few minutes that she wasn't a bitafraid of interrupting him,) `i'll give him sixpence
  _i_ don'tbelieve there's an atom of meaning in it
'  the jury all wrote down on their slates, `she doesn't believethere's an atom of meaning in it,' but none of them attempted toexplain the paper
  `if there's no meaning in it,' said the king, `that saves aworld of trouble, you know, as we needn't try to find any
  andyet i don't know,' he went on, spreading out the verses on hisknee, and looking at them with one eye; `i seem to see somemeaning in them, after all
  "--said i could not swim--" youcan't swim, can you
' he added, turning to the knave
  the knave shook his head sadly
  `do i look like it
' he said
(which he certainly did not, being made entirely of cardboard
)  `all right, so far,' said the king, and he went on mutteringover the verses to himself:  `"we know it to be true--" that'sthe jury, of course-- "i gave her one, they gave him two--" why,that must be what he did with the tarts, you know--'  `but, it goes on "they all returned from him to you,"' saidalice
  `why, there they are
' said the king triumphantly, pointing tothe tarts on the table
  `nothing can be clearer than that
then again--"before she had this fit--"  you never had fits, mydear, i think
' he said to the queen
  `never
' said the queen furiously, throwing an inkstand at thelizard as she spoke
  (the unfortunate little bill had left offwriting on his slate with one finger, as he found it made nomark; but he now hastily began again, using the ink, that wastrickling down his face, as long as it lasted
)  `then the words don't fit you,' said the king, looking roundthe court with a smile
  there was a dead silence
  `it's a pun
' the king added in an offended tone, andeverybody laughed, `let the jury consider their verdict,' theking said, for about the twentieth time that day
  `no, no
' said the queen
  `sentence first--verdict afterwards
'  `stuff and nonsense
' said alice loudly
  `the idea of havingthe sentence first
'  `hold your tongue
' said the queen, turning purple
  `i won't
' said alice
  `off with her head
' the queen shouted at the top of her voice
nobody moved
  `who cares for you
' said alice, (she had grown to her fullsize by this time
)  `you're nothing but a pack of cards
'  at this the whole pack rose up into the air, and came flyingdown upon her:  she gave a little scream, half of fright and halfof anger, and tried to beat them off, and found herself lying onthe bank, with her head in the lap of her sister, who was gentlybrushing away some dead leaves that had fluttered down from thetrees upon her face
  `wake up, alice dear
' said her sister; `why, what a longsleep you've had
'  `oh, i've had such a curious dream
' said alice, and she toldher sister, as well as she could remember them, all these strangeadventures of hers that you have just been reading about; andwhen she had finished, her sister kissed her, and said, `it was acurious dream, dear, certainly:  but now run in to your tea; it'sgetting late
'  so alice got up and ran off, thinking while sheran, as well she might, what a wonderful dream it had been
  but her sister sat still just as she left her, leaning herhead on her hand, watching the setting sun, and thinking oflittle alice and all her wonderful adventures, till she too begandreaming after a fashion, and this was her dream:--  first, she dreamed of little alice herself, and once again thetiny hands were clasped upon her knee, and the bright eager eyeswere looking up into hers--she could hear the very tones of hervoice, and see that queer little toss of her head to keep backthe wandering hair that would always get into her eyes--andstill as she listened, or seemed to listen, the whole placearound her became alive the strange creatures of her littlesister's dream
  the long grass rustled at her feet as the white rabbit hurriedby--the frightened mouse splashed his way through theneighbouring pool--she could hear the rattle of the teacups asthe march hare and his friends shared their never-ending meal,and the shrill voice of the queen ordering off her unfortunateguests to execution--once more the pig-baby was sneezing on theduchess's knee, while plates and dishes crashed around it--oncemore the shriek of the gryphon, the squeaking of the lizard'sslate-pencil, and the choking of the suppressed guinea-pigs,filled the air, mixed up with the distant sobs of the miserablemock turtle
  so she sat on, with closed eyes, and half believed herself inwonderland, though she knew she had but to open them again, andall would change to dull reality--the grass would be onlyrustling in the wind, and the pool rippling to the waving of thereeds--the rattling teacups would change to tinkling sheep-bells, and the queen's shrill cries to the voice of the shepherdboy--and the sneeze of the baby, the shriek of the gryphon, andall thy other queer noises, would change (she knew) to theconfused clamour of the busy farm-yard--while the lowing of thecattle in the distance would take the place of the mock turtle'sheavy sobs
  lastly, she pictured to herself how this same little sister ofhers would, in the after-time, be herself a grown woman; and howshe would keep, through all her riper years, the simple andloving heart of her childhood:  and how she would gather abouther other little children, and make their eyes bright and eagerwith many a strange tale, perhaps even with the dream ofwonderland of long ago:  and how she would feel with all theirsimple sorrows, and find a pleasure in all their simple joys,remembering her own child-life, and the happy summer days
